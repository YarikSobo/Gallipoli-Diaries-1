      <p>PREFACE</p>
      <p>
         On the heels of the South African War came the sleuth-hounds pursuing
         the criminals, I mean the customary Royal Commissions. Ten thousand
         words of mine stand embedded in their Blue Books, cold and dead as so
         many mammoths in glaciers. But my long spun-out intercourse with the
         Royal Commissioners did have living issue--my Manchurian and Gallipoli
         notes. Only constant observation of civilian Judges and soldier
         witnesses could have shown me how fallible is the unaided military
         memory or have led me by three steps to a War Diary:--</p>
      
      
      <p>(1) There is nothing certain about war except that one side won't win.</p>
      
      
      <p>(2) The winner is asked no questions--the loser has to answer for
         everything.</p>
      
      
      <p>(3) Soldiers think of nothing so little as failure and yet, to the
         extent of fixing intentions, orders, facts, dates firmly in their own
         minds, they ought to be prepared.</p>
      
      
      <p>Conclusion:--In war, keep your own counsel, preferably in a note-book.</p>
      
      
      <p>The first test of the new resolve was the Manchurian Campaign, 1904-5;
         and it was a hard test. Once that Manchurian Campaign was over I never
         put pen to paper--in the diary sense[1]--until I was under orders for
         <span class="location">Constantinople</span>. Then I bought a note-book as well as a Colt's automatic
         (in fact, these were the only two items of special outfit I did buy),
         and here are the contents--not of the auto but of the book. Also, from
         the moment I took up the command, I kept cables, letters and copies
         (actions quite foreign to my natural disposition), having been taught in
         my youth by Lord Roberts that nothing written to a Commander-in-Chief,
         or his Military Secretary, can be private if it has a bearing on
         operations. A letter which may influence the Chief Command of an Army
         and, therefore, the life of a nation, may be "Secret" for reasons of
         State; it cannot possibly be "Private" for personal reasons.[2]</p>
      
      
      <p>At the time, I am sure my diary was a help to me in my work. The
         crossings to and from <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> gave me many chances of reckoning up
         the day's business, sometimes in clear, sometimes in a queer cipher of
         my own. Ink stands with me for an emblem of futurity, and the act of
         writing seemed to set back the crisis of the moment into a calmer
         perspective. Later on, the diary helped me again, for although the
         Dardanelles Commission did not avail themselves of my formal offer to
         submit what I had written to their scrutiny, there the records were.
         Whenever an event, a date and a place were duly entered in their actual
         coincidence, no argument to the contrary could prevent them from falling
         into the picture: an advocate might just as well waste eloquence in
         disputing the right of a piece to its own place in a jig-saw puzzle.
         Where, on the other hand, incidents were not entered, anything might
         happen and did happen;  vide , for instance, the curious misapprehension
         set forth in the footnotes to pages 59, 60, Vol. II.</p>
      
      
      <p>So much for the past. Whether these entries have not served their turn
         is now the question. They were written red-hot amidst tumult, but
         faintly now, and as in some far echo, sounds the battle-cry that once
         stopped the beating of thousands of human hearts as it was borne out
         upon the night wind to the ships. Those dread shapes we saw through our
         periscopes are dust: "the pestilence that walketh in darkness" and "the
         destruction that wasteth at noonday" are already images of speech: only
         the vastness of the stakes; the intensity of the effort and the grandeur
         of the sacrifice still stand out clearly when we, in dreams, behold the
         Dardanelles. Why not leave that shining impression as a martial cloak to
         cover the errors and vicissitudes of all the poor mortals who, in the
         words of Thucydides, "dared beyond their strength, hazarded against
         their judgment, and in extremities were of an excellent hope?"</p>
      
      
      <p>Why not? The tendency of every diary is towards self-justification and
         complaint; yet, to-day, personally, I have "no complaints." Would it not
         be wiser, then, as well as more dignified, to let the Dardanelles
         R.I.P.? The public will not be starved. A Dardanelles library exists---
         nothing less--from which three luminous works by Masefield, Nevinson and
         <span class="person">Callwell</span> stand out; works each written by a man who had the right to
         write; each as distinct from its fellow as one primary colour from
         another, each essentially true. On the top of these comes the Report of
         the Dardanelles Commission and the Life of Lord Kitchener, where his
         side of the story is so admirably set forth by his intimate friend, Sir
         George Arthur. The tale has been told and retold. Every morsel of the
         wreckage of our Armada seems to have been brought to the surface. There
         are fifty reasons against publishing, reasons which I know by heart. On
         the other side there are only three things to be said:--</p>
      
      
      <p>(1) Though the bodies recovered from the tragedy have been stripped and
         laid out in the Morgue, no hand has yet dared remove the masks from
         their faces.</p>
      
      
      <p>(2) I cannot destroy this diary. Before his death Cranmer thrust his own
         hand into the flames: "his heart was found entire amidst the ashes."</p>
      
      
      <p>(3) I will not leave my diary to be flung at posterity from behind the
         cover of my coffin. In case anyone wishes to challenge anything I have
         said, I must be above ground to give him satisfaction.</p>
      
      
      <p>Therefore, I will publish and at once.</p>
      
      
      <p>A man has only one life on earth. The rest is silence. Whether God will
         approve of my actions at a moment when the destinies of hundreds of
         millions of human beings hung upon them, God alone knows. But before I
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>, and until they know the truth, as it appeared to me at the
         time, how can they give that verdict?

         LETTER FROM <span class="person">GENERAL D'AMADE</span> TO THE AUTHOR</p>
      
      
      <p>
         MON GENERAL,</p>
      
      
      <p>Dans la guerre Sud Africaine, ensuite en Angleterre, j'avais en
         spectateur vecu avec votre armee. Avec elle je souhaitais revivre en
         frere d'armes, combattant pour la meme cause.</p>
      
      
      <p>Les <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> ont realise mon reve. Mais le lecteur ne doit pas
         s'attarder avec moi. Lire le recit de celui meme qui a commande: quel
         avantage! L'Histoire, comme un fleuve, se charge d'impuretes en
         s'eloignent de ses sources. En en remontant le cours, dans votre
         Journal, j'ai decouvert les causes de certains effets demeure, pour moi
         des enigmes.</p>
      
      
      <p>Au debut je n'avais pas cru a la possibilite de forcer les <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>
         sans l'intervention de l'armee. C'est pour cela que, si la decision
         m'eut appartenus et avant d'avoir ete place sous vos ordres, j'avais
         songe a debarquer a Adramit, dans les eaux calmes de Mithylene, a courir
         ensuite a Brousse et Constantinople, pour y saisir les clefs du detroit.</p>
      
      
      <p>En presence de l'opiniatre confiance de l'amiral de Robecq j'abaissai
         mon pavillion de terrien et l'inclinai devant son autorite de marin
         Anglais. Nous fumes conquis par cette confiance.</p>
      
      
      <p>Notre theatre de guerre de Gallipoli etait tres borne sur le terrain. Ce
         front restreint a permis a chacun de vos soldats de vous connaitre.
         Autant qu'avec leurs armes, ils combattaient avec votre ardeur de grand
         chef et votre inflexible volonte.</p>
      
      
      <p>Dans le passe ce theatre qui etait la Troade, venait se souder aux
         eternels recommencements de l'Histoire.</p>
      
      
      <p>Dans l'avenir son domaine etait aussi vaste. "Si nos navires avaient pu
         franchir les detroits, a dit le Premier Ministre Loyd Georges le 18
         decembre 1919 aux Communes, la guerre aurait ete raccourcie de 2 ou 3
         ans."</p>
      
      
      <p>Il y a pire qu'une guerre, c'est une guerre qui se prolonge. Car les
         devastations s'accumulent. Le vaincu qui a eu l'habilete de les eviter a
         son pays, se donnera, sur les ruines, des manieres de vainqueur. Le
         premier but de guerre n'est il pas d'infliger a l'adversaire plus de mal
         qu'il ne vous en fait?</p>
      
      
      <p>Si nous avions atteint Constantinople dans l'ete 1915 c'etait alors
         terminer la guerre, eviter la tourmente russe et tous les obstacles
         dresses par ce cataclysme devant le retablissement de la paix du monde.
         C'etait epargner a nos Patries des milliards de depenses et des
         centaines de milliers de deuils.</p>
      
      
      <p>Que nous n'ayons pas atteint ce but ne saurait etablir qu'il n'ait ete
         juste et sage de le poursuivre.</p>
      
      
      <p>Voila pour quelle cause sont tombes les soldats des <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>.
         "Honneur a vous, soldats de <span class="location">France</span> et soldats du Roi! ainsi que vous
         les adjuriez en les lancant a l'attaque.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Morts heroiques! il n'a rien manque a votre gloire, pas meme une
         apparence d'oubli. Des triomphes des autres vous n'avez recueilli que
         les rayons extremes: ceux qui ont franchi la cime des arcs de triomphe
         pour aller au loin, coups egares de la grande gerbe, eclairer vos
         tombes.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Mais 'Ne jugez pas avant le temps.' Le crepuscule eteint, laissez
         encore passer la nuit. Vous aurez pour vous le soleil Levant."</p>
      
      
      <p>Vous, Mon General, vous aurez ete l'ouvrier de cette grande idee, et
         l'annonciateur de cette aurore.

      <p>CHAPTER I THE START</p>
      
      
      
      <p>In the train between Paris and Marseilles, 14th March, 1915. </p>
      
      
      <p>Neither the Asquith banquet, nor the talk at the Admiralty that midnight
         had persuaded me I was going to do what I am actually doing at this
         moment. <span class="person">K.</span> had made no sign nor waved his magic baton. So I just kept as
         cool as I could and had a sound sleep.</p>
      
      
      <p>Next morning, that is the 12th instant, I was working at the Horse
         Guards when, about 10 a.m., <span class="person">K.</span> sent for me. I wondered! Opening the door
         I bade him good morning and walked up to his desk where he went on
         writing like a graven image. After a moment, he looked up and said in a
         matter-of-fact tone, "We are sending a military force to support the
         Fleet now at the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>, and you are to have Command."</p>
      
      
      <p>Something in voice or words touched a chord in my memory. We were once
         more standing, <span class="person">K.</span> and I, in our workroom at <span class="location">Pretoria</span>, having just
         finished reading the night's crop of sixty or seventy wires. <span class="person">K.</span> was
         saying to me, "You had better go out to the <span class="location">Western Transvaal</span>." I asked
         no question, packed up my kit, ordered my train, started that night. Not
         another syllable was said on the subject. Uninstructed and unaccredited
         I left that night for the front; my outfit one A.D.C., two horses, two
         mules and a buggy. Whether I inspected the columns and came back and
         reported to <span class="person">K.</span> in my capacity as his Chief Staff Officer; or, whether,
         making use of my rank to assume command in the field, I beat up de la
         Rey in his den--all this rested entirely with me.</p>
      
      
      <p>So I made my choice and fought my fight at <span class="location">Roodewal</span>, last strange battle
         in the West. That is <span class="person">K.</span>'s way. The envoy goes forth; does his best with
         whatever forces he can muster and, if he loses;--well, unless he had
         liked the job he should not have taken it on.</p>
      
      
      <p>At that moment <span class="person">K.</span> wished me to bow, leave the room and make a start as I
         In those old <span class="location">Pretoria</span> days I had known the <span class="location">Transvaal</span> by heart; the
         number, value and disposition of the British forces; the characters of
         the Boer leaders; the nature of the country. But my knowledge of the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> was nil; of the Turk nil; of the strength of our own forces
         next to nil. Although I have met <span class="person">K.</span> almost every day during the past six
         months, and although he has twice hinted I might be sent to <span class="location">Salonika</span>;
         never once, to the best of my recollection, had he mentioned the word
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>I had plenty of time for these reflections as <span class="person">K.</span>, after his one
         tremendous remark had resumed his writing at the desk. At last, he
         looked up and inquired, "Well?"</p>
      
      
      <p>"We have done this sort of thing before, <span class="person">Lord K.</span>" I said; "we have run
         this sort of show before and you know without saying I am most deeply
         grateful and you know without saying I will do my best and that you can
         trust my loyalty--but I must say something--I must ask you some
         questions." Then I began.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">K.</span> frowned; shrugged his shoulders; I thought he was going to be
         impatient, but although he gave curt answers at first he slowly
         broadened out, until, at the end, no one else could get a word in
         edgeways.[3]</p>
      
      
      <p>My troops were to be Australians and New Zealanders under <span class="person">Birdwood</span> (a
         friend); strength, say, about 30,000. (A year ago I inspected them in
         their own Antipodes and no finer material exists); the <span class="unit">29th Division</span>,
         strength, say 19,000 under <span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span>--a slashing man of action; an
         acute theorist; the <span class="unit">Royal Naval Division</span>, 11,000 strong (an excellent
         type of Officer and man, under a solid Commander--<span class="person">Paris</span>); a French
         contingent, strength at present uncertain, say, about a Division, under
         my old war comrade the chivalrous <span class="person">d'Amade</span>, now at Tunis.</p>
      
      
      <p>Say then grand total about 80,000--probably panning out at some 50,000
         rifles in the firing line. Of these the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> are
         extras-- division de luxe. </p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">K.</span> went on; he was now fairly under weigh and got up and walked about
         the room as he spoke. I knew, he said, his (<span class="person">K.</span>'s) feelings as to the
         political and strategic value of the Near East where one clever tactical
         thrust delivered on the spot and at the spot might rally the wavering
         Balkans. Rifle for rifle,  at that moment , we could nowhere make as
         good use of the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> as by sending it to the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>, where
         each of its 13,000 rifles might attract a hundred more to our side of
         the war. Employed in <span class="location">France</span> or Flanders the <span class="unit">29th</span> would at best help to
         push back the German line a few miles; at the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> the stakes
         were enormous. He spoke, so it struck me, as if he was defending himself
         in argument: he asked if I agreed. I said, "Yes." "Well," he rejoined,
         "You may just as well realize at once that G.H.Q. in <span class="location">France</span> do not
         agree. They think they have only to drive the Germans back fifty miles
         nearer to their base to win the war. Those are the same fellows who used
         to write me saying they wanted no New Army; that they would be amply
         content if only the old Old Army and the Territorials could be kept up
         to strength. Now they've been down to Aldershot and seen the New Army
         they are changing their tune, but I am by no means sure,  now , that
         I'll give it to them. French and his Staff believe firmly that the
         British Imperial Armies can pitch their camp down in one corner of
         Europe and there fight a world war to a finish. The thing is absurd but
         French, plus <span class="location">France</span>, are a strong combine and they are fighting tooth
         and nail for the <span class="unit">29th Division</span>. It must clearly be understood then:--"</p>
      
      
      <p>(1) That the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> are only to be a loan and are to be returned
         the moment they can be spared.</p>
      
      
      <p>(2) That all things ear-marked for the East are looked on by powerful
         interests both at home and in <span class="location">France</span> as having been stolen from the
         West.</p>
      
      
      <p>Did I take this in? I said, "I take it from you." Did I myself, speaking
         as actual Commander of the Central Striking Force and executively
         responsible for the land defence of <span class="location">England</span>, think the <span class="unit">29th Division</span>
         could be spared at all? "Yes," I said, "and four more Territorial
         Divisions as well." <span class="person">K.</span> used two or three very bad words and added, with
         his usual affability, that I would find myself walking about in civilian
         costume instead of going to <span class="location">Constantinople</span> if he found me making any
         wild statements of that sort to the politicians. I laughed and reminded
         him of my testimony before the Committee of Imperial Defence about my
         Malta amphibious manoeuvres; about the <span class="location">Malta</span> Submarines and the way
         they had destroyed the battleships conveying my landing forces. If there
         was any politician, I said, who cared a hang about my opinions he knew
         quite well already my views on an invasion of <span class="location">England</span>; namely, that it
         would be like trying to hurt a monkey by throwing nuts at him. I didn't
         want to steal what French wanted, but now that the rifles had come and
         the troops had finished their musketry, there was no need to squabble
         over a Division. Why not let French have two of my <span class="unit">Central Force
            Territorial Division</span> at once,--they were jolly good and were wasting
         their time over here. That would sweeten French and he and Joffre would
         make no more trouble about the <span class="unit">29th</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">K.</span> glared at me. I don't know what he was going to say when <span class="person">Callwell</span>
         came into the room with some papers.</p>
      
      
      <p>We moved to the map in the window and <span class="person">Callwell</span> took us through a plan of
         attack upon the Forts at the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>, worked out by the Greek
         General Staff. The Greeks had meant to employ (as far as I can remember)
         150,000 men. Their landing was to have taken place on the North-west
         coast of the Southern part of <span class="location">the Peninsula</span>, opposite <span class="location">Kilid Bahr</span>. "But,"
         said <span class="person">K.</span>, "half that number of men will do you handsomely; the Turks are
         busy elsewhere; I hope you will not have to land at all; if you  do 
         have to land, why then the powerful Fleet at your back will be the prime
         factor in your choice of time and place."</p>
      
      
      <p>I asked <span class="person">K.</span> if he would not move the Admiralty to work a submarine or two
         up the Straits at once so as to prevent reinforcements and supplies
         coming down by sea from <span class="location">Constantinople</span>. By now the Turks must be on the
         alert and it was commonsense to suppose they would be sending some sort
         of help to their Forts. However things might pan out we could not be
         going wrong if we made the <span class="location">Marmora</span> unhealthy for the Turkish ships.
         <span class="person">Lord K.</span> thereupon made the remark that if we could get one submarine into the
         <span class="location">Marmora</span> the defences of the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> would collapse. "Supposing," he
         said, "one submarine pops up opposite the <span class="location">town of Gallipoli</span> and waves a
         Union Jack three times, the whole Turkish garrison on <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> will
         take to their heels and make a bee line for <span class="location">Bulair</span>."</p>
      
      
      <p>In reply to a question about Staff, <span class="person">Lord K.</span>, in the gruff voice he puts
         on when he wants no argument, told me I could not take my own Chief of
         Staff, <span class="person">Ellison</span>, and that <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> would go with me in his place.
         <span class="person">Ellison</span> and I have worked hand in glove for several years; our qualities
         usefully complement one another; there was no earthly reason I could
         think of why <span class="person">Ellison</span> should  not  have come with me, but; I like
         <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>; he had been on my General Staff for a time in the Southern
         Command; he is cheery, popular and competent.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Wolfe Murray</span>, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, was then called
         in, also <span class="person">Archie Murray</span>, Inspector of Home Forces, and <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>. This
         was the first (apparently) either of the Murrays had heard of the
         project!!! Both seemed to be quite taken aback, and I do not remember
         that either of them made a remark.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Braithwaite</span> was very nice and took a chance to whisper his hopes he
         would not give me too much cause to regret <span class="person">Ellison</span>. He only said one
         thing to <span class="person">K.</span> and that produced an explosion. He said it was vital that we
         should have a better air service than the Turks in case it came to
         fighting over a small area like <span class="location">the Gallipoli Peninsula</span>: he begged,
         therefore, that whatever else we got, or did not get, we might be fitted
         out with a contingent of up-to-date aeroplanes, pilots and observers. <span class="person">K.</span>
         turned on him with flashing spectacles and rent him with the words,
         "Not one !"</p>
      
      
      <p> 15th March, 1915. <span class="location">H.M.S. "Phaeton."</span> <span class="location">Toulon Harbour</span>.  Embarked at
         Marseilles last night at 6 p.m. and slept on board. Owing to some
         mistake no oil fuel had been taken aboard so we have had to come round
         here this morning to get it. Have just breakfasted with the Captain,
         Cameron by name, and have let the Staff go ashore to see the town. We do
         not sail till 2 p.m.: after special trains and everything a clean
         chuck-away of 20 hours.</p>
      
      
      <p>I left off in the S. of S.'s room at the War Office. After the bursting
         of the aeroplane bomb <span class="person">K.</span> did most of the talking. I find it hard to
         remember all he said: here are the outstanding points:--</p>
      
      
      <p>(1) We soldiers are to understand we are string Number 2. The sailors
         are sure they can force the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> on their own and the whole
         enterprise has been framed on that basis: we are to lie low and to bear
         in mind the Cabinet does not want to hear anything of the Army till it
         sails through the Straits. But if the Admiral fails, then we will have
         to go in.</p>
      
      
      <p>(2) If the Army has to be used, whether on the <span class="location">Bosphorus</span> or at the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>, I am to bear in mind his order that no serious operation is
         to take place until the whole of my force is complete; ready;
         concentrated and on the spot. No piecemeal attack is to be made.</p>
      
      
      <p>(3) If we do start fighting, once we  have  started we are to burn our
         boats. Once landed the Government are resolved to see the enterprise
         through.</p>
      
      
      <p>(4) Asia is out of bounds. <span class="person">K.</span> laid special stress on this. Our sea
         command and the restricted area of Gallipoli would enable us to
         undertake a landing on <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> with clearly limited liabilities.
         Once we began marching about continents, situations calling for heavy
         reinforcements would probably be created. Although I, Hamilton, seemed
         ready to run risks in the defence of London, he, <span class="person">K.</span>, was not, and as he
         had already explained, big demands would make his position difficult
         with <span class="location">France</span>; difficult everywhere; and might end by putting him (<span class="person">K.</span>) in
         the cart. <span class="location">Besika Bay</span> and <span class="location">Alexandretta</span> were, therefore, taboo--not to be
         touched! Even after we force the Narrows no troops are to be landed
         along the Asian coastline. Nor are we to garrison any part of the
         <span class="location">Gallipoli Peninsula</span> excepting only the <span class="location">Bulair</span> Lines which had best be
         permanently held, <span class="person">K.</span> thinks, by the <span class="unit">Naval Division</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>When we get into the <span class="location">Marmora</span> I shall be faced by a series of big
         problems. What would I do? From what quarter could I attack
         <span class="location">Constantinople</span>? How would I hold it when I had taken it? <span class="person">K.</span> asked me
         the questions.</p>
      
      
      <p>With the mud of prosaic Whitehall drying upon my boots these remarks of
         <span class="person">K.</span>'s sounded to me odd. But, knowing <span class="location">Constantinople</span>, and--what was more
         to the point at the moment--knowing <span class="person">K.</span>'s hatred of hesitation, I managed
         to pull myself together so far as to suggest that if the city was weakly
         held and if, as he had said, (I forgot to enter that) the bulk of the
         Thracian troops were dispersed throughout the Provinces, or else moving
         to re-occupy Adrianople, why then, possibly, by a  coup de main , we
         might pounce upon the <span class="location">Chatalja</span> Lines from the South before the Turks
         could climb back into them from the North.<span class="person"> Lord K.</span> made a grimace; he
         thought this too chancy. The best would be if we did not land a man
         until the Turks had come to terms. Once the Fleet got through the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>,<span class="location">Constantinople</span> could not hold out. Modern<span class="location">Constantinople</span>
         could not last a week if blockaded by sea and land. That was a sure
         thing; a thing whereon he could speak with full confidence. The Fleet
         could lie off out of sight and range of the Turks and with their guns
         would dominate the railways and, if necessary, burn the place to ashes.
         The bulk of the people were not Osmanli or even Mahomedan and there
         would be a revolution at the mere sight of the smoke from the funnels of
         our warships. But if, for some cause at present non-apparent, we were
         forced to put troops ashore against organized Turkish opposition, then
         he advocated a landing on the Asiatic side of the <span class="location">Bosphorus</span> to hold out
         a hand to the Russians, who would simultaneously land there from the
         Black Sea. He only made the suggestion, for the man on the spot must be
         the best judge. Several of the audience left us here, at <span class="person"> Lord K.</span>'s
         suggestion, to get on with their work. <span class="person">K.</span> went on:--</p>
      
      
      <p>The moment the holding of <span class="location">Constantinople</span> comes along the French and the
         Russians will be very jealous and prickly. Luckily we British have an
         easy part to play as the more we efface ourselves at that stage, the
         better he, <span class="person">K.</span>, will be pleased. The Army in <span class="location">France</span> have means of making
         their views work in high places and pressure is sure to be put on by
         them and by their friends for the return of the <span class="unit">29th</span> and <span class="unit">Naval</span> Divisions
         the moment we bring <span class="location">Turkey</span> to book. Therefore, it will be best in any
         case to "let the French and Russians garrison <span class="location">Constantinople</span> and sing
         their hymns in S. Sophia," whilst my own troops hold the railway line
         and perhaps <span class="location">Adrianople</span>. Thus they will be at a loose end and we shall be
         free to bring them back to the West; to land them at <span class="location">Odessa</span> or to push
         them up the Danube, without weakening the Allied grip on the waterway
         linking the Mediterranean with the Black Sea.</p>
      
      
      <p>This was the essence of our talk: as it lasted about an hour and a half,
         I can only have put down about one tenth of it.</p>
      
      
      <p>At odd times I have been recipient of <span class="person">K.'s</span> reveries but always,
         always , he has rejected with a sort of horror the idea of being War
         Minister or Commander-in-Chief. Now by an extreme exercise of its ironic
         spirit, Providence has made him both.</p>
      
      
      <p>In pre-war days, when we met in <span class="location">Egypt</span> and at <span class="location">Malta</span>, <span class="person">K.</span> made no bones
         about what he wanted. He wanted to be Viceroy of India or Ambasssador at
         <span class="location">Constantinople</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>I remember very well one conversation we had when I asked him why he
         wanted to hang on to great place, and whether he had not done enough
         already. He said he could not bear to see <span class="location">India</span> being mismanaged by
         nincompoops or our influence in <span class="location">Turkey</span> being chucked out of the window
         with both hands: I answered him, I remember, by saying there were only
         two things worth doing as Viceroy and they would not take very long. One
         was to put a huge import duty on aniline dyes and so bring back the
         lovely vegetable dyes of old India, the saffrons, indigoes, madders,
         etc.; the other was to build a black marble Taj at Agra opposite the
         white and join the two by a silver bridge. I expected to get a rise, but
         actually he took the ideas quite seriously and I am sure made a mental
         note of them. Anyway, as Viceroy, <span class="person">K.</span> would have flung the whole vast
         weight of India into the scale of this war; he would have poured Army
         after Army from East to West. Under <span class="person">K.</span> India could have beaten <span class="location">Turkey</span>
         single-handed; aye, and with one arm tied behind her back. With <span class="person">K.</span> as
         Ambassador at <span class="location">Constantinople</span> he would have prevented <span class="location">Turkey</span> coming into
         the war. There is no doubt of it. Neither <span class="person">Enver Pasha</span> nor <span class="person">Talaat</span> would
         have dared to enrage <span class="person">K.</span>, and as for the idea of their deporting him, it
         is grotesque. They might have shot him in the back; they could never
         have faced him with a war declaration in their hands. As an impresser
         of Orientals he is a nonesuch. So we put him into the War Office in the
         ways of which he is something of an amateur, with a big prestige and a
         big power of drive. Yes, we remove the best experts from the War Office
         and pop in <span class="person">K.</span> like a powerful engine from which we have removed all
         controls, regulators and safety valves. Yet see what wonders he has
         worked!</p>
      
      
      <p>Still, he remains, in the War Office sense, an amateur. The Staff left
         by French at the W.O. may not have been von Moltke's, but they were <span class="person">K.</span>'s
         only Councillors. An old War Office hand would have used them. But in no
         case, even had they been the best, could <span class="person">K.</span> have had truck or parley
         with any system of decentralization of work--of semi-independent
         specialists each running a show of his own. As late (so-called) Chief of
         Staff to <span class="person">Lord K.</span> in <span class="location">South Africa</span>, I could have told them that whatever
         work <span class="person">K.</span> fancies at the moment he must swipe at it, that very moment, off
         his own bat. The one-man show carried on royally in <span class="location">South Africa</span> and all
         the narrow squeaks we had have been completely swallowed up in the final
         success; but how will his no-system system work now? Perhaps he may pull
         it through; anyway he is starting with a beautifully cleaned slate. He
         has surpassed himself, in fact, for I confess even with past experience
         to guide me, I did not imagine our machinery could have been so
         thoroughly smashed in so short a time. Ten long years of General Staff;
         Lyttelton, Nicholson, French, Douglas; where are your well-thought-out
         schemes for an amphibious attack on <span class="location">Constantinople</span>? Not a sign!
         <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> set to work in the Intelligence Branch at once. But beyond
         the ordinary text books those pigeon holes were drawn blank. The
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> and <span class="location">Bosphorus</span> might be in the moon for all the military
         information I have got to go upon. One text book and one book of
         travellers' tales don't take long to master and I have not been so free
         from work or preoccupation since the war started. There is no use trying
         to make plans unless there is some sort of material, political, naval,
         military or geographical to work upon.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Winston</span> had been in a fever to get us off and had ordered a special
         train for that very afternoon. My new Staff were doubtful if they could
         get fixed up so quickly and <span class="person">K.</span> settled the matter by saying there was no
         need to hustle. For myself, I was very keen to get away. The best plan
         to save slips between cup and lip is to swallow the liquor. But <span class="person">K.</span>
         thought it wisest to wait, so I 'phoned over to Eddie to let <span class="person">Winston</span>
         know we should not want his train that day.</p>
      
      
      <p>Next morning, the 13th, I handed over the Central Force Command to
         <span class="person">Rundle</span> and then, at 10.30 went in with <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> to say good-bye. <span class="person">K.</span>
         was standing by his desk splashing about with his pen at three different
         drafts of instructions. One of them had been drafted by Fitz--I suppose
         under somebody's guidance; the other was by young Buckley; the third <span class="person">K.</span>
         was working on himself.<span class="person">Braithwaite</span>, Fitz and I were in the room; no one
         else except <span class="person">Callwell</span> who popped in and out. The instructions went over
         most of the ground of yesterday's debate and were too vague. When<span class="person"> I
            </span>asked the crucial question:--the enemy's strength? <span class="person">K.</span> thought I had
         better be prepared for 40,000. How many guns? No one knows. Who was in
         command? <span class="person">Djavad Pasha</span>, it is believed. But, <span class="person">K.</span> says, I may take it that
         the <span class="location">Kilid Bahr Plateau</span> has been entrenched and is sufficiently held.
         South of <span class="location">Kilid Bahr Plateau</span> to the point at <span class="location">Cape Helles</span>, I may take it that the
         Peninsula is open to a landing on very easy terms. The cross fire from
         the Fleet lying part in the <span class="location">Aegean</span> and part in the mouth of the Straits
         must sweep that flat and open stretch of country so as to render it
         untenable by the enemy.<span class="person"> Lord K.</span> demonstrated this cross fire upon the
         map. He toiled over the wording of his instructions. They were headed
         "<span class="location">Constantinople</span> Expeditionary Force." I begged him to alter this to
         avert Fate's evil eye. He consented and both this corrected draft and
         the copy as finally approved are now in <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> despatch box more
         modestly headed "Mediterranean Expeditionary Force." None of the drafts
         help us with facts about the enemy; the politics; the country and our
         allies, the Russians. In sober fact these "instructions" leave me to my
         own devices in the East, almost as much as <span class="person">K.'s</span> laconic order "git" left
         me to myself when I quitted <span class="location">Pretoria</span> for the West thirteen years ago.</p>
      
      
      <p>So I said good-bye to old <span class="person">K.</span> as casually as if we were to meet together
         at dinner. Actually my heart went out to my old Chief. He was giving me
         the best thing in his gift and I hated to leave him amongst people who
         were frightened of him. But there was no use saying a word. He did not
         even wish me luck and I did not expect him to, but he did say, rather
         unexpectedly,  after  I had said good-bye and just as I was taking up my
         cap from the table, "If the Fleet gets through, <span class="location">Constantinople</span> will fall
         of itself and you will have won, not a battle, but the war."</p>
      
      
      <p>At 5 o'clock that afternoon we bade adieu to <span class="location">London</span>. <span class="person">Winston</span> was
         disappointed we didn't dash away yesterday but we have not really let
         much grass grow under our feet. He and some friends came down to Charing
         Cross to see us off. I told <span class="person">Winston</span> <span class="person">Lord K.</span> would not think me loyal if
         I wrote to another Secretary of State. He understood and said that if I
         "You will agree perhaps that the <span class="person">First Lord</span> should see." Then the S. of
         S. for War would be bound to show him the letter:--which proves that
         with all his cleverness <span class="person">Winston</span> has yet some points to learn about his
         K. of K.!</p>
      
      
      <p>My Staff still bear the bewildered look of men who have hurriedly been
         snatched from desks to do some extraordinary turn on some unheard of
         theatre. One or two of them put on uniform for the first time in their
         lives an hour ago. Leggings awry, spurs upside down, belts over shoulder
         straps! I haven't a notion of who they all are: nine-tenths of my few
         hours of warning has been taken up in winding up the affairs of the
         Central Force.</p>
      
      
      <p>At <span class="location">Dover</span> embarked on <span class="location">H.M.S.  Foresight </span>,--a misnomer, for we ran into a
         fog and had to lie-to for a devil of a time. Heard far-off guns on
         French front,--which was cheering.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 10.30 p.m. we left <span class="location">Calais</span> for <span class="location">Marseilles</span> and during the next day the
         French authorities caused me to be met by Officers of their Railway
         Mobilization Section. Had my first breathing space wherein to talk over
         matters with <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>, and <span class="person">he</span> and I tried to piece together the
         various scraps of views we had picked up at the War Office into a
         pattern which should serve us for a doctrine. But we haven't got very
         much to go upon. A diagram he had drawn up with half the spaces unfilled
         showing the General Staff. Another diagram with its blank spaces only
         showed that our Q. branch was not in being. Three queried names,
         <span class="person">Woodward</span> for A.G., Winter for Q.M.G. and <span class="person">Williams</span> for Cipher Officer.
         The first two had been left behind, the third was with us. The following
         hurried jottings by <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>:--"Only 1600 rounds for the 4.5
         Howitzers!!! High Explosive essential. Who is to be C.R.E.? Engineer
         Stores? French are to remain at <span class="location">Tunis</span> until the day comes that they are
         required. Egyptian troops also remain in <span class="location">Egypt</span> till last moment.
         Everything we want by 30th (it is hoped). Await arrival of <span class="unit">29th Division</span>
         before undertaking anything big. If <span class="person">Carden</span> wants military help it is for
         <span class="person">Sir Ian's</span> consideration whether to give or to withhold it." These rough
         notes; the text book on the Turkish Army, and two small guide books: not
         a very luminous outfit. <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> tells me our force are not to take
         with them the usual 10 per cent. extra margin of reserves to fill
         casualties. Wish I had realised this earlier. He had not time to tell
         me he says. The General Staff thought we ought certainly to have these
         and <span class="person">he</span> and <span class="person">Wolfe Murray</span> went in and made a personal appeal to the A.G.
         But <span class="person">he</span> was obdurate. This seems hard luck. Why should we not have our
         losses quickly replaced--supposing we do lose men? I doubt though, if I
         should have been able to do very much even if I had known. To press <span class="person">K.</span>
         would have been difficult. Like insisting on an extra half-crown when
         you've just been given Fortunatus' purse. Still, fair play's a jewel,
         and surely if formations destined for the French front cross the Channel
         with 10 per cent. extra, over and above their establishment, troops
         bound for <span class="location">Constantinople</span> ought to have a 25 per cent. margin over
         establishment?</p>
      
      
      <p> 17th March, 1915. <span class="location">H.M.S. "Phaeton."</span> At sea.  Last night we raced past
         <span class="location">Corfu</span>--my birthplace--at thirty knots an hour. My first baby breath was
         drawn from these thyme scented breezes. This crimson in the Eastern sky,
         these waves of liquid opal are natal, vital.</p>
      
      
      <p>Thirty miles an hour through Paradise! Since the 16th January, 1853, we
         have learnt to go the pace and as a result the world shrinks; the
         horizons close in upon us; the spacious days are gone!</p>
      
      
      <p>Thoughts of my <span class="person">Mother</span>, who died when I was but three. Thoughts of her
         refusal as she lay dying--gasping in mortal pain--her refusal to touch
         an opiate, because the Minister, Norman Macleod, had told her she so
         might dim the clearness of her spiritual insight--of her thoughts
         ascending heavenwards. What pluck--what grit--what faith--what an
         example to a soldier.</p>
      
      
      <p>Exquisite, exquisite air; sea like an undulating carpet of blue velvet
         outspread for Aphrodite. Have been in the <span class="location">Aegean</span> since dawn. At noon
         passed a cruiser taking back <span class="person">Admiral Carden</span> invalided to <span class="location">Malta</span>. One week
         ago the thunder of his guns shook the firm foundations of the world. Now
         a sheer hulk lies poor old <span class="person">Carden</span>.  Vanitas vanitatum .</p>
      
      
      <p>Have got into touch with my staff. They are all General Staff: no
         Administrative Staff. The Adjutant-General-to-be (I don't know him) and
         the Chief Medico (I don't know who he is to be) could not get ready in
         time to come off with us, and the Q.M.G., too, was undecided when I
         Quite characteristic of <span class="person">K.</span>, though, that barring <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>, not one of
         the associates he has told off to work hand in glove with me in this
         enterprise should ever have served with me before.</p>
      
      
      <p>Only two sorts of Commanders-in-Chief could possibly find time to
         scribble like this on their way to take up an enterprise in many ways
         unprecedented--a German and a Britisher. The first, because every
         possible contingency would have been worked out for him beforehand; the
         second, because he has nothing--literally nothing--in his portfolio
         except a blank cheque signed with those grand yet simple words--John
         Bull. The German General is the product of an organising nation. The
         British General is the product of an improvising nation. Each army would
         be better commanded by the other army's General. Sounds fantastic but is
         true.[4]</p>

      <p>CHAPTER II THE STRAITS</p>
      
      
      
      <p>
         Cast anchor at <span class="location">Tenedos</span> at 3 p.m., 17th March, 1915, having entered the
         harbour at the very same instant as le <span class="person">general d'Amade</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Hurried over at once to a meeting aboard that lovely sea monster, <span class="location">H.M.S.
            Queen Elizabeth </span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Present:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  <span class="person">Admiral de Robeck</span>,
         <span class="person">Commodore Roger Keyes</span>,
         <span class="person">Admiral Guepratte</span>, cmdg. French Fleet,
         <span class="person">General d'Amade</span>,
         <span class="person">General Braithwaite</span>,
         <span class="person">Admiral Wemyss</span>,
         <span class="person">Captain Pollen</span>,
         <span class="person">Myself</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">De Robeck</span> greeted me in the friendliest fashion. He is a fine looking
         man with great charm of manner. After a word or two to <span class="person"> d'Amade</span> and being
         introduced to <span class="person">Admiral Wemyss</span>, <span class="person">Guepratte</span> and <span class="person">Keyes</span>, we sat down round a table and
         the <span class="person">Admiral</span> began. His chief worry lies in the clever way the enemy are
         now handling their mobile artillery. He can silence the big fortress
         ordnance, but the howitzers and field guns fire from concealed
         positions and make the clearing of the minefields something of a V.C.
         sort of job for the smaller craft. Even when the Fleet gets through,
         these moveable guns will make it very nasty for store ships or
         transports which follow. The mine-sweepers are slow and bad with worn
         out engines. Some of the civilian masters and crews of the trawlers have
         to consider wives and kids as well as V.C.s. The problem of getting the
         Fleet through or of getting submarines through is a problem of clearing
         away the mines. With a more powerfully engined type of mine-sweeper and
         regular naval commanders and crews to man them, the business would be
         easy. But as things actually stand there is real cause for anxiety as to
         mines.</p>
      
      
      <p>The Peninsula itself is being fortified and many Turks work every night
         on trenches, redoubts and entanglements. Not one single living soul has
         been seen, since the engagement of our Marines at the end of February,
         although each morning brings forth fresh evidences of nocturnal
         activity, in patches of freshly turned up soil. All landing places are
         now commanded by lines of trenches and are ranged by field guns and
         howitzers, which, thus far, cannot be located as our naval seaplanes are
         too heavy to rise out of rifle range. There has been a muddle about
         these seaplanes. Nominally they possess very powerful Sunbeam engines;
         actually the d----d things can barely rise off the water. The naval
         guns do not seem able to knock the Turkish Infantry out of their deep
         trenches although they can silence their fire for awhile. This was
         proved at that last landing by Marines. The Turkish searchlights are
         both fixed and mobile. They are of the latest pattern and are run by
         skilled observers. He gave us, in fact, to understand that German
         thoroughness and forethought have gripped the old go-as-you-please Turk
         and are making him march to the  Parade-schritt .</p>
      
      
      <p>The <span class="person">Admiral</span> would prefer to force a passage on his own, and is sure he
         can do so. Setting <span class="location">Constantinople</span> on one side for the moment,  if  the
         Fleet gets through and the Army  then  attacks at <span class="location">Bulair</span>, we would have
         the Turkish Army on <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> in a regular trap. Therefore, whether
         from the local or the larger point of view, he has no wish to call us in
         until he has had a real good try. He means straightway to put the whole
         proposition to a practical test.</p>
      
      
      <p>His views dovetail in to a hair's breadth with <span class="person">K.</span>'s views. The <span class="person">Admiral's</span>
         "real good try" leads up towards <span class="person">K.</span>'s "after every effort has been
         exhausted."</p>
      
      
      <p>That's a bit of luck for our kick-off, anyway. What we soldiers have to
         do now is to hammer away at our band-o-bast[5] whilst the Navy pushes as
         hard, as fast and as far as its horsepower, manpower and gunpower will
         carry it.</p>
      
      
      <p>The <span class="person">Admiral</span> asked to see my instructions and <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> read them out.
         When he stopped, <span class="person">Roger Keyes, the Commodore</span>, inquired, "Is that all?"
         And when <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> confessed that it was, everyone looked a little
         blank.</p>
      
      
      <p>Asked what I meant to do, I said I proposed to get ready for a landing,
         as, whether the Fleet forces the passage and disembarked us on the
         <span class="location">Bosphorus</span>; or, whether the Fleet did not force the passage and we had to
         "go for" <span class="location">the Peninsula</span>, the  band-o-bast  could be made to suit either
         case.</p>
      
      
      <p>The <span class="person">Admiral</span> asked if I meant to land at <span class="location">Bulair</span>? I replied my mind was
         open on that point: that I was a believer in seeing things for myself
         and that I would not come to any decision on the map if it were possible
         to come to it on the ground. He then said he would send me up to look at
         the place through my own glasses in the <span class="location">Phaeton</span> to-morrow; that it would
         not be possible to land large forces on the neck of <span class="location">Bulair</span> itself as
         there were no beaches, but that I should reconnoitre the coast at the
         head of the Gulf as landing would be easier with every few miles we drew
         away towards the North. I told him it would be useless to land at any
         distance from my objective, for the simple reason that I had no
         transport, mechanical or horse, wheeled or pack, to enable me to support
         myself further than five or six miles from the Fleet and it would take
         many weeks and many ships to get it together; however, I ended, I would
         to-morrow see for myself.</p>
      
      
      <p>The air of the <span class="location">Aegean</span> hardly differs so much from the <span class="location">North Sea</span> haze as
         does the moral atmosphere of <span class="location">Tenedos</span> differ from that of the War Office.
         This is always the way. Until the plunge is taken, the man in the arm
         chair clamps rose coloured spectacles on to his nose and the man on the
         spot is anxious;  but , once the men on the spot jump off they become
         as jolly as sandboys, whilst the man in the arm chair sits searching for
         a set-back with a blue lens telescope.</p>
      
      
      <p>Here, <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> looks a tougher nut to crack than it did on <span class="person">Lord K.</span>'s
         small and featureless map. I do not speak for myself for I have so far
         only examined the terrain through a field glass. I refer to the tone of
         the sailors, which strikes me as being graver and less irresponsible
         than the tone of the War Office.</p>
      
      
      <p>The <span class="person">Admiral</span> believes that, at the time of the first bombardment, 5000
         men could have marched from <span class="location">Cape Helles</span> right up to the <span class="location">Bulair</span> lines.
         (Before leaving the ship I learnt that some of the sailors do not
         agree). Now that phase has passed. Many more troops have come down,
         German Staff Officers have grappled with the situation, and have got
         their troops scientifically disposed and heavily entrenched. This
         skilful siting of the Turkish trenches has been admired by all competent
         British observers; the number of field guns on <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> is now many
         times greater than it was.</p>
      
      
      <p>After this the discussion became informal. Referring again to my
         instructions, I laid stress on the point that I was a waiting man and
         that it was the <span class="person">Admiral's</span> innings for so long as he could keep his
         wicket up.<span class="person">Braithwaite</span> asked a question or two about the trenches and
         all of us deplored the lack of aeroplanes whereby we were blinded in our
         attack upon an enemy who espied every boat's crew moving over the
         water.</p>
      
      
      <p>The more I revolve these matters in my mind, the more easy does it seem
         to accept <span class="person">K.</span>'s order not to be in too great a hurry to bring the Army to
         the front. I devoutly hope indeed (and I think the fiercest of our
         fellows agree) that the Navy will pull us out the chestnuts from the
         fire.</p>
      
      
      <p>At the close of the sitting I made these notes of what had happened and
         drafted a first cable to <span class="person">Lord K.</span>, giving him an epitome of the <span class="person">Admiral's</span>
         opening statement about the enemy's clever use of field guns to hinder
         the clearing of the minefields; his good entrenchments and the nightly
         work thereon; our handicap in all these matters because the type of
         seaplanes sent us "are too heavy to rise out of effective rifle
         range"--(one has to put these things mildly). I add that the <span class="person">Admiral</span>,
         "while not making light of dangers was evidently determined to exhaust
         every effort before calling upon the soldiers for their help on a large
         scale"; and I wind up by telling him <span class="location">Lemnos</span> seems a bad base and that I
         am off to-morrow on an inspection of the coasts of <span class="location">the Peninsula</span>. Having
         got these matters off my chest on to the chest of <span class="person">K.</span>, was then taken
         round the ship by the Flag Captain, G.P.W. Hope. By this time it was
         nearly 7 so I stayed and dined with the <span class="person">Admiral</span>--a charming host. After
         dinner got back here.</p>
      
      
      <p> 18th March, 1915.  <span class="location"> H.M.S. "Phaeton." </span> Cleared <span class="location">Tenedos</span> Harbour at 4
         a.m. and reached <span class="location">Lemnos</span> at 6 a.m. I never saw so many ships collected
         together in my life; no, not even at <span class="location">Hong Kong</span>, <span class="location">Bombay</span> or <span class="location">New York</span>.
         Filled up with oil fuel and at 7 a.m. <span class="person">d'Amade</span> and Major-General <span class="person">Paris</span>,
         commanding the <span class="unit">Royal Naval Division</span>, came on board with one or two Staff
         Officers. After consulting these Officers as well as <span class="person">McLagan, the
            Australian Brigadier</span>, cabled <span class="person">Lord K.</span> to say <span class="location">Alexandria</span>  must  be our
         base as "the <span class="unit">Naval Division</span> transports have been loaded up as in peace
         time and they must be completely discharged and every ship reloaded," in
         war fashion. At <span class="location">Lemnos</span>, where there are neither wharfs, piers, labour
         nor water, the thing could not be done. Therefore, "the closeness of
         <span class="location">Lemnos</span> to the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>, as implying the rapid transport of troops, is
         illusory."</p>
      
      
      <p>The moment I got this done, namely, at 8.30 a.m., we worked our way out
         of the long narrow neck of <span class="location">Mudros Harbour</span> and sailed for the <span class="location">Gulf of
            Saros</span>. Spent the first half of the sixty mile run to the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> in
         scribbling. Wrote my first epistle to <span class="person">K.</span>, using for the first time the
         formal "Dear <span class="person">Lord Kitchener</span>." My letters to him will have to be formal,
         and dull also, as he may hand them around. I begin, "I have just sent
         you off a cable giving my first impressions of the situation, and am now
         steaming in company with Generals <span class="person">d'Amade</span> and <span class="person">Paris</span> to inspect the
         North-western coast of <span class="location">the Gallipoli Peninsula</span>." I tell him that the
         real place "looks a much tougher nut to crack than it did over the
         map,"--I say that his "impression that the ground between <span class="location">Cape Helles</span>
         and <span class="location">Krithia</span> was clear of the enemy," was mistaken. "Not a bit of it." I
         say, "The <span class="person">Admiral</span> tells me that there is a large number of men tucked
         away in the folds of the ground there, not to speak of several field
         Batteries." Therefore, I conclude, "If it eventually becomes necessary
         to take <span class="location">the Gallipoli Peninsula</span> by military force, we shall have to
         proceed bit by bit." This will vex him no doubt. He likes plans to move
         as fast as his own wishes and is apt to forget, or to pretend he has
         forgotten, that swiftness in war comes from slow preparations. It is
         fairer to tell <span class="person">K.</span> this now, when the question has not yet arisen, than
         hereafter if it does then arise.</p>
      
      
      <p>Passing the mouth of the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> we got a wonderful view of the
         stage whereon the Great Showman has caused so many of his amusing
         puppets to strut their tiny hour. For the purpose it stands matchless.
         No other panorama can touch it. There, Hero trimmed her little lamp;
         yonder the amorous breath of Leander changed to soft sea form. Far away
         to the Eastwards, painted in dim and lovely hues, lies Mount Ida. Just
         so, on the far horizon line she lay fair and still, when Hector fell and
         smoke from burning Troy blackened the mid-day sun. Against this
         enchanted background to deeds done by immortals and mortals as they
         struggled for ten long years five thousand years ago,--stands forth
         formidably <span class="location">the Peninsula</span>. Glowing with bright, springtime colours it
         sweeps upwards from the sea like the glacis of a giant's fortress.</p>
      
      
      <p>So we sailed on Northwards, giving a wide berth to the shore. When we
         got within a mile of the head of the <span class="location">Gulf of Saros</span>, we turned, steering
         a South-westerly course, parallel to, and one to two miles distant from,
         the coastline. Then my first fears as to the outworks of the fortress
         were strengthened. The head of the <span class="location">Gulf</span> is filled in with a horrible
         marsh. No landing there. Did we land far away to the Westward we must
         still march round the marsh, or else we must cross it on one single road
         whose long and easily destructible bridges we could see spanning the bog
         holes some three miles inland. Opposite the fortified lines we stood in
         to within easy field gun range, trusting that the Turks would not wish
         prematurely to disclose their artillery positions. So we managed a peep
         at close quarters, and were startled to see the ramifications and extent
         of the spider's web of deep, narrow trenches along the coast and on
         either front of the lines of <span class="location">Bulair</span>. My Staff agree that they must have
         taken ten thousand men a month's hard work from dark to dawn. In advance
         of the trenches, Williams in the crow's nest reported that with his
         strong glasses he could pick out the glitter of wire over a wide expanse
         of ground. To the depth of a mile the whole Aegean slope of the neck of
         <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> was scarred with spade work and it is clear to a tiro that
         to take these trenches would take from us a bigger toll of ammunition
         and life than we can afford: especially so seeing that we can only see
         one half of the theatre; the other half would have to be worked out of
         sight and support of our own ships and in view of the Turkish Fleet.
         Only one small dent in the rockbound coast offered a chance of landing
         but that was also heavily dug in. In a word, if <span class="location">Bulair</span> had been the only
         way open to me and I had no alternative but to take it or wash my hands
         of the whole business, I should have to go right about turn and cable
         my master he had sent me on a fool's errand.</p>
      
      
      <p>Between <span class="location">Bulair</span> and <span class="location">Suvla Bay</span> the coastline was precipitous; high cliffs
         and no sort of creeks or beaches--impracticable. <span class="location">Suvla Bay</span> itself seems
         a fine harbour but too far North were the aim to combine a landing there
         together with an attack on the Southern end of <span class="location">the Peninsula</span>. Were we,
         on the other hand, to try to work the whole force ashore from <span class="location">Suvla Bay</span>,
         the country is too big; it is the broadest part of <span class="location">the Peninsula</span>; also,
         we should be too far from its waist and from the Narrows we wish to
         dominate. Merely to hold our line of Communications we should need a
         couple of Divisions. All the coast between <span class="location">Suvla Bay</span> and for a little
         way South of <span class="location">Gaba Tepe</span> seems feasible for landing. I mean we could get
         ashore on a calm day if there was no enemy. <span class="location">Gaba Tepe</span> itself would be
         ideal, but, alas, the Turks are not blind; it is a mass of trenches and
         wire. Further, it must be well under fire of guns from <span class="location">Kilid Bahr plateau</span>
         , and is entirely commanded by the high ridge to the North of it.
         To land there would be to enter a defile without first crowning the
         heights.</p>
      
      
      <p>Between <span class="location">Gaba Tepe</span> and <span class="location">Cape Helles</span>, the point of <span class="location">the Peninsula</span>, the
         coastline consists of cliffs from 100 to 300 feet high. But there are,
         in many places, sandy strips at their base. Opinions differ but I
         in going for at least one spot that  seems  impracticable.</p>
      
      
      <p>Sailing Southwards we are becoming more and more conscious of the
         tremendous bombardment going on in the Straits. Now and then, too, we
         can see a huge shell hit the top of <span class="location">Achi Baba</span> and turn it into the
         semblance of a volcano. Everyone excited and trying to look calm.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 4 p.m., precisely, we rounded <span class="location">Cape Helles</span>. I had promised <span class="person">de Robeck</span>
         not to take his fastest cruiser, fragile as an egg, into the actual
         Straits, but the Captain and the Commander (<span class="person">Cameron</span> and <span class="person">Rosomore</span>), were
         frightfully keen to see the fight, and I thought it fair to allow one
         mile as being the  mouth  of the Straits and not  the  Straits. Before
         we had covered that mile we found ourselves on the outskirts of--dream
         of my life--a naval battle! Nor did the reality pan out short of my
         hopes. Here it was; we had only to keep on at thirty knots; in one
         minute we should be in the thick of it; and who would be brave enough to
         cry halt!</p>
      
      
      <p>The world had gone mad; common sense was only moonshine after all; the
         elephant and the whale of Bismarckian parable were at it tooth and nail!
         Shells of all sizes flew hissing through the skies. Before my very eyes,
         the graves of those old Gods whom Christ had risen from the dead to
         destroy were shaking to the shock of Messrs. Armstrong's patent thunder
         bolts!</p>
      
      
      <p>Ever since the far-away days of <span class="location">Afghanistan</span> and Majuba Hill friends have
         been fond of asking me what soldiers feel when death draws close up
         beside them. Before he charged in at <span class="location">Edgehill</span>, <span class="person">Astley</span> (if my memory
         serves me) exclaimed, "O, God, I've been too busy fixing up this battle
         to think much about you, but, for Heaven's sake, don't you go and
         forget about me," or words to that effect.</p>
      
      
      <p>The Yankee's prayer for fair play just as he joined issue with the
         grizzly bear gives another glimpse of these secrets between man and his
         Maker. As for myself, there are two moments; one when I think I would
         not miss the show for millions; another when I think "what an ass I am
         to be here"; and between these two moments there  is  a border land when
         the mind runs all about Life's workshop and tries to do one last bit of
         stock-taking.</p>
      
      
      <p>But the process can no more be fixed in the memory than the sequence of
         a dream when the dew is off the grass. All I remember is a sort of
         wonder:--why these incredible pains to seek out an amphibious battle
         ground whereon two sets of people who have no cause of quarrel can blow
         one another to atoms? Why are these Straits the cockpit of the world?
         What is it all about? What on earth has happened to sanity when the
         whale and elephant are locked in mortal combat making between them a
         picture which might be painted by one of H.M.'s Commissioners in Lunacy
         to decorate an asylum for homicides.</p>
      
      
      <p>Whizz--flop--bang--what an ass I am to be here. If we keep on another
         thirty seconds we are in for a visit to Davy Jones's Locker.</p>
      
      
      <p>Now above the <span class="location"> Queen Elizabeth </span>, making slowly backwards and forwards up
         in the neck of the Narrows, were other men-o'-war spitting tons of hot
         metal at the Turks. The Forts made no reply--or none that we could make
         out, either with our ears or with glasses. Perhaps there was an attempt;
         if so, it must have been very half-hearted. The enemy's fixed defences
         were silenced but the concealed mobile guns from <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> and from
         Asia were far too busy and were having it all their own way.</p>
      
      
      <p>Close to us were steam trawlers and mine-sweepers steaming along with
         columns of spray spouting up close by them from falling field gun
         shells, with here and there a biggish fellow amongst them, probably a
         five or six inch field howitzer. One of them was in the act of catching
         a great mine as we drew up level with her. Some 250 yards from us was
         the <span class="location"> Inflexible </span> slowly coming out of the Straits, her wireless cut away
         and a number of shrapnel holes through her tops and crow's nest.
         Suddenly, so quickly did we turn that, going at speed, the decks were at
         an angle of 45 deg. and several of us (<span class="person">d'Amade</span> for one) narrowly escaped
         slipping down the railless decks into the sea. The <span class="location"> Inflexible </span> had
         signalled us she had struck a mine, and that we must stand by and see
         her home to <span class="location">Tenedos</span>. We spun round like a top (escaping thereby a salvo
         of four from a field battery) and followed as close as we dared.</p>
      
      
      <p>My blood ran cold--for sheer deliberate awfulness this beat everything.
         We gazed spellbound: no one knew what moment the great ship might not
         dive into the depths. The pumps were going hard. We fixed our eyes on
         marks about the water line to see if the sea was gaining upon them or
         not. She was very much down by the bows, that was a sure thing. Crew and
         stokers were in a mass standing strictly at attention on the main deck.
         A whole bevy of destroyers crowded round the wounded warrior. In the
         sight of all those men standing still, silent, orderly in their ranks,
         facing the imminence of death, I got my answer to the hasty moralizings
         about war, drawn from me (really) by a regret that I would very soon be
         drowned. On the deck of <span class="location">that battleship</span> staggering along at a stone's
         throw was a vindication of war in itself; of war, the state of being,
         quite apart from war motives or gains. Ten thousand years of peace would
         fail to produce a spectacle of so great virtue. Where, in peace,
         passengers have also shown high constancy, it is because war and martial
         discipline have lent them its standards. Once in a generation a
         mysterious wish for war passes through the people. Their instinct tells
         them that  there is no other way  of progress and of escape from habits
         that no longer fit them. Whole generations of statesmen will fumble over
         reforms for a lifetime which are put into full-blooded execution within
         a week of a declaration of war. There is  no other way . Only by intense
         sufferings can the nations grow, just as the snake once a year must with
         anguish slough off the once beautiful coat which has now become a strait
         jacket.</p>
      
      
      <p>How was it going to end? How touching the devotion of all these small
         satellites so anxiously forming escort? Onwards, at snail's pace, moved
         our cortege which might at any moment be transformed into a funeral
         affair, but slow as we went we yet went fast enough to give the go-by
         to the <span class="location">French battleship  Gaulois </span>, also creeping out towards <span class="location">Tenedos</span> in
         a lamentable manner attended by another crowd of T.B.s and destroyers
         eager to stand to and save.</p>
      
      
      <p>The <span class="location"> Inflexible </span> managed to crawl into <span class="location">Tenedos</span> under her own steam but
         we stood by until we saw the <span class="location"> Gaulois </span> ground on some rocks called
         <span class="location">Rabbit Island</span>, when I decided to clear right out so as not to be in the
         way of the Navy at a time of so much stress. After we had gone ten miles
         or so, the <span class="location"> Phaeton </span> intercepted a wireless from the <span class="location"> Queen Elizabeth </span>,
         ordering the <span class="location"> Ocean </span> to take the <span class="location"> Irresistible </span> in tow, from which it
         would appear that <span class="location">she (the  Irresistible )</span> has also met with some
         misfortune.</p>
      
      
      <p>Thank God we were in time! That is my dominant feeling. We have seen a
         spectacle which would be purchased cheap by five years of life and, more
         vital yet, I have caught a glimpse of the forces of the enemy and of
         their Forts. What with my hurried scamper down the Aegean coast of the
         Peninsula and the battle in the Straits, I begin to form some first-hand
         notion of my problem. More by good luck than good guidance I have got
         into personal touch with the outer fringes of the thing we are up
         against and that is so much to the good. But oh, that we had been here
         earlier! <span class="person">Winston</span> in his hurry to push me out has shown a more soldierly
         grip than those who said there was no hurry. It is up to me now to
         revolve to-day's doings in my mind; to digest them and to turn myself
         into the eyes and ears of the War Office whose own so far have
         certainly not proved themselves very acute. How much better would I be
         able to make them see and hear had I been out a week or two; did I know
         the outside of <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> by heart; had I made friends with the
         Fleet! And why should I not have been?</p>
      
      
      <p>Have added a P.S. to <span class="person">K.</span>'s letter:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"Between <span class="location">Tenedos</span> and <span class="location">Lemnos</span>. 6 p.m.--This has been a very bad day for us
         judging by what has come under my own personal observation. After going
         right up to <span class="location">Bulair</span> and down again to the South-west point looking at the
         network of trenches the Turks have dug commanding all possible landing
         places, we turned into the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> themselves and went up about a
         mile. The scene was what I believe Naval writers describe as 'lively.'"
         (Then follows an account based on my Diary jottings). I end:</p>
      
      
      <p>"I have not had time to reflect over these matters, nor can I yet
         realise on my present slight information the extent of these losses.
         Certainly it looks at present as if the Fleet would not be able to carry
         on at this rate, and, if so, the soldiers will have to do the trick.":</p>
      
      
      <p>"Later.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The <span class="location"> Irresistible </span>, the <span class="location"> Ocean </span> and the <span class="location"> Bouvet </span> are gone! The
         <span class="location"> Bouvet </span>, they say, just slithered down like a saucer slithers down in a
         bath. The <span class="location"> Inflexible </span> and the <span class="location"> Gaulois </span> are badly mauled."</p>
      
      
      <p> 19th March, 1915.  <span class="location"> H.M.S. "Franconia</span>." --Last night I left <span class="location">H.M.S.
            Phaeton </span> and went on board the <span class="location"> Franconia </span>. To-day, we have been busy
         fixing things up. The chance sailors, seen by the Staff, have been using
         highly coloured expletives about the mines. Sheer bad luck they swear;
         bad luck that would not happen once in a hundred tries. They had knocked
         out the Forts, they claim, and one, three-word order, "Full steam
         ahead," would have cut the Gordian Knot the diplomats have been fumbling
         at for over a hundred years by slicing their old <span class="location">Turkey</span> in two. Then
         came the big delay owing to ships changing stations during which mines
         set loose from up above had time to float down the current, when, by the
         Devil's own fluke, they impinge upon our battleships, and blow <span class="person">de Robeck</span>
         and his plans into the middle of next week--or later! These are
         ward-room yarns. <span class="person">De Robeck</span> was working by stages and never meant, so far
         as we know, to run through to the <span class="location">Marmora</span> yesterday.</p>
      
      
      <p>Cabled to <span class="person">Lord K.</span> telling him of yesterday's reconnaissance by me and
         the battle by <span class="person">de Robeck</span>. Have said I have no official report to go upon
         but from what I saw with my own eyes "I am being most reluctantly driven
         to the conclusion that the Straits are not likely to be forced by
         battleships as at one time seemed probable and that, if my troops are to
         take part, it will not take the subsidiary form anticipated. The Army's
         part will be more than mere landings of parties to destroy Forts, it
         must be a deliberate and progressive military operation carried out at
         full strength so as to open a passage for the Navy."</p>
      
      
      <p>To be able, if necessary, to act up to my own words I sent another
         message to the <span class="person">Admiral</span> and told him, if he could spare the troops from
         the vicinity of the Straits, I would like to take them right off to
         <span class="location">Alexandria</span> so as to shake them out there and reship them ready for
         anything. He has wirelessed back asking me, on political grounds, to
         delay removing the troops "until our attack is renewed in a few days'
         time."</p>
      
      
      <p>Bravo, the <span class="person">Admiral</span>! Still; if there are to be even a few days' delay I
         <span class="location">Alexandria</span> is the only port possible.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Wemyss</span> has just sent me over the following letter. It confirms
         officially the loss of the three battleships:--</p>
      
      
      <p>                                                               Friday. </p>
      
      
      <p>  "My Dear General,</p>
      
      
      <p>"The enclosed is a copy of a Signal I have received from <span class="person">de Robeck</span>. I
         what results we have achieved I think. I gather from intercepted signals
         that the  Ocean  also is sunk, but of this I am not quite certain. I am
         off in  Dublin  immediately she comes in and expect I may be back
         to-night. This of course depends a good deal upon what <span class="person">de Robeck</span> wants.

      <p>"Negative demonstration at <span class="location">Gaba Tepe</span>, 19th. Will you come to <span class="location">Tenedos</span> and
         see me to-morrow. We have had disastrous day owing either to floating

      <p>After I was asleep last night, an answer came in from <span class="person">K.</span>, straight,
         strong and to the point. He says, "You know my view that the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>

         <span class="location">Gallipoli Peninsula</span> by your troops are necessary to clear the way, those

         defences and must be carried through."</p>

         <span class="person">General d'Amade</span>. <span class="person">Wemyss</span> is clear that the Navy must not admit a check
         and must get to work again as quickly as they can. Wemyss is Senior
         Naval Officer at the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> and is much liked by everyone. He has
         put his seniority in his pocket and is under his junior--fighting first,

      <p>A letter from <span class="person">de Robeck</span>, dated "<span class="location">Q.E.</span> the 19th," has only just come to
         hand:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"Our men were splendid and thank heaven our loss of life was quite
         small, though the French lost over 100 men when <span class="location"> Bouvet </span> struck a mine.</p>
      
      
      <p>"How our ships struck mines in an area that was reported clear and swept
         the previous night I do not know, unless they were floating mines
         started from the Narrows!</p>
      
      
      <p>"I was sad to lose ships and my heart aches when one thinks of it; one
         must do what one is told and take risks or otherwise we cannot win. We
         are all getting ready for another 'go' and not in the least beaten or
         downhearted. The big forts were silenced for a long time and everything
         was going well, until  <span class="location">Bouvet</span>  struck a mine. It is hard to say what
         amount of damage we did, I don't know, there were big explosions in the
         Forts!"</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Little Birdie</span>, now grown up into a grand General, turned up at 3 p.m.<span class="person">Ian Hamilton I
            </span>was enchanted to see him. We had hundreds and thousands of things to
         talk over. Although the confidence of the sailors seems quite unshaken
         by the events of the 18th, <span class="person">Birdie</span> seems to have made up his mind that
         the Navy have shot their bolt for the time being and that we have no
         time to lose in getting ready for a landing. But then he did not see the
         battle and cannot, therefore, gauge the extent to which the Turkish
         Forts were beaten.</p>
      
      
      <p> 22nd March, 1915.  <span class="location"> H.M.S. "Franconia</span>."  At 10 a.m. we had another
         Conference on board the <span class="location"> Queen Elizabeth </span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Present:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  <span class="person">Admiral de Robeck</span>,
         <span class="person">Admiral Wemyss</span>,
         <span class="person">General Birdwood</span>,
         <span class="person"> General Braithwaite</span>,
         <span class="person">Captain Pollen</span>,
         <span class="person">Myself</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>The moment we sat down <span class="person">de Robeck</span> told us  he was now quite clear he
         could not get through without the help of all my troops .</p>
      
      
      <p>Before ever we went aboard <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>, Birdwood and I had agreed that,
         whatever we landsmen might think, we must leave the seamen to settle
         their own job, saying nothing for or against land operations or
         amphibious operations until the sailors themselves turned to us and said
         they had abandoned the idea of forcing the passage by naval operations
         alone.</p>
      
      
      <p>They have done so. The fat (that is us) is fairly in the fire.</p>
      
      
      <p>No doubt we had our views. <span class="person">Birdie</span> and my own Staff disliked the idea of
         chancing mines with million pound ships. The hesitants who always make
         hay in foul weather had been extra active since the sinking of the three
         men-of-war. Suppose the Fleet  could  get through with the loss of
         another battleship or two--how the devil would our troopships be able to
         follow? And the store ships? And the colliers?</p>
      
      
      <p>This had made me turn contrary. During the battle I had cabled that the
         chances of the Navy pushing through on their own were hardly fair
         fighting chances, but, since then, <span class="person">de Robeck</span>, the man who should know,
         had said twice that he  did  think there was a fair fighting chance. Had
         he stuck to that opinion at the conference, then I was ready, as a
         soldier, to make light of military croaks about troopships.
         <span class="location">Constantinople</span> must surrender, revolt or scuttle within a very few hours
         of our battleships entering the <span class="location">Marmora</span>. Memories of one or two obsolete
         six inchers at Ladysmith helped me to feel as <span class="location">Constantinople</span> would feel
         when her rail and sea communications were cut and a rain of shell fell
         upon the penned-in populace from <span class="person">de Robeck</span>'s terrific batteries. Given a
         good wind that nest of iniquity would go up like Sodom and Gomorrah in a
         winding sheet of flame.</p>
      
      
      <p>But once <span class="person">the Admiral</span> said his battleships could not fight through
         without help, there was no foothold left for the views of a landsman.</p>
      
      
      <p>So there was no discussion. At once we turned our faces to the land
         scheme. Very sketchy; how could it be otherwise? On the German system
         plans for a landing on Gallipoli would have been in my pocket,
         up-to-date and worked out to a ball cartridge and a pail of water. By
         the British system (?) I have been obliged to concoct my own plans in a
         brace of shakes almost under fire. Strategically and tactically our
         method may have its merits, for though it piles everything on to one
         man, the Commander, yet he is the chap who has got to see it through.
         But, in matters of supply, transport, organisation and administration
         our way is the way of Colney Hatch.</p>
      
      
      <p>Here am I still minus my Adjutant-General; my Quartermaster-General and
         my Medical Chief, charged with settling the basic question of whether
         the Army should push off from <span class="location">Lemnos</span> or from <span class="location">Alexandria</span>. Nothing in the
         world to guide me beyond my own experience and that of my <span class="person">Chief of the
            General Staff</span>, whose sphere of work and experience lies quite outside
         these administrative matters. I can see that <span class="location">Lemnos</span> is practically
         impossible; I fix on <span class="location">Alexandria</span> in the light of <span class="person">Braithwaite's</span> advice and
         my own hasty study of the map. Almost incredible really, we should have
         to decide so tremendous an administrative problem off the reel and
         without any Administrative Staff. But time presses, the responsibility
         cannot be shirked, and so I have cabled <span class="person">K.</span> that <span class="location">Lemnos</span> must be a
         wash-out and that I am sending my troops to get ship-shape at <span class="location">Alexandria</span>
         although, thereby, I upset every previous arrangement. Then I have had
         to cable for Engineers, trench mortars, bombs, hand grenades,
         periscopes. Then again, seeing things are going less swimmingly than <span class="person">K.</span>
         had thought they would, I have had to harden my heart against his horror
         of being asked for more men and have decided to cable for leave to bring
         over from <span class="location">Egypt</span> <span class="unit">a Brigade of Gurkhas</span> to complete <span class="unit">Birdwood's New Zealand
            Division</span>. Last, and worst, I have had to risk the fury of the Q.M.G. to
         the Forces by telling the War Office that their transports are so loaded
         (water carts in one ship; water cart horses in another; guns in one
         ship; limbers in another; entrenching tools anyhow) that they must be
         emptied and reloaded before we can land under fire.</p>
      
      
      <p>These points were touched upon at the Conference. I told them too that
         my Intelligence folk fix the numbers of the enemy now at the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>
         as 40,000 on <span class="location">the Gallipoli Peninsula</span> with a reserve of 30,000 behind
         <span class="location">Bulair</span>: on the Asiatic side of the Straits there are at least a
         Division, but there  may  be several Divisions. The <span class="person">Admiral</span>'s
         information tallies and, so <span class="person">Birdie</span> says, does that of the Army in <span class="location">Egypt</span>.
         The War Office notion that the guns of the Fleet can sweep the enemy off
         the tongue of <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> from <span class="location">Achi Baba</span> Southwards is moonshine. My
         trump card turns out to be the Joker; best of all cards only it don't
         happen to be included in this particular pack!</p>
      
      
      <p>As ideas for getting round this prickly problem were passing through my
         mind, two suggestions for dealing with it were put forward. The sailors
         say some lighters were being built, and probably by now are built, for
         the purpose of a landing in the North: they would carry five hundred
         men; had bullet-proof bulwarks and are to work under their own gas
         engines. If I can possibly get a petition for these through to <span class="person">Winston</span>
         we would very likely be lent some and with their aid the landing under
         fire will be child's play to what it will be otherwise. But the cable
         must get to <span class="person">Winston</span>: if it falls into the hands of <span class="person">Fisher</span> it fails, as
         the sailors tell me he is obsessed by the other old plan and grudges us
         every rope's end or ha'porth of tar that finds its way out here.</p>
      
      
      <p>Rotten luck to have cut myself off from wiring to <span class="person">Winston</span>: still I see
         no way out of it: with <span class="person">K.</span> jealous as a tiger--what can I do? Also,
         although the sailors want me to pull this particular chestnut out of the
         fire, it is just as well they should know I am not going to speak to
         <span class="person">their Boss</span> even under the most tempting circs.: but they won't cable
         themselves: frightened of <span class="person">Fisher</span>: so I then and there drafted this to <span class="person">K.</span>
         from myself:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"Our first step of landing under fire will be the most critical as well
         as the most vital of the whole operations. If the Admiralty will
         improvise and send us out post haste 20 to 30 large lighters difficulty
         and duration of this phase will be cut down to at least one half. The
         lighters should each be capable of conveying 400 to 500 men or 30 to 40
         horses. They should be protected by bullet-proof armour."</p>
      
      
      <p>Everyone agreed but <span class="person">Birdwood</span> pointed out that, by sending this message,
         we implied in so many words, that we would not land until the lighters
         came out from <span class="location">England</span>. He assumed that we had definitely turned down any
         plan of scrambling ashore forthwith, as best we could? I said, "Yes,"
         and that the Navy were with me in that view, a statement confirmed by <span class="person">de
            Robeck</span> and <span class="person">Wemyss</span> who nodded their heads. <span class="person">Birdwood</span> said he only wanted
         to be quite clear about it, and there the matter dropped.</p>
      
      
      <p>Actually I had thought a lot about that possibility. To a man of my
         temperament there was every temptation to have a go in and revenge the
         loss of the battleships forthwith. We might sup to-morrow night on <span class="location">Achi
            Baba</span>. With luck we really might. Had I been here for ten days instead of
         five, and had I had any time to draft out any sort of scheme, I might
         have had a dart. But the operation of landing in face of an enemy is the
         most complicated and difficult in war. Under existing conditions the
         whole attempt would be partial,  decousu , happy-go-lucky to the last
         degree. There are no small craft to speak of. There is no provision for
         carrying water. There is no information  at all  about springs or wells
         ashore. There is no arrangement for getting off the wounded and my
         Principal Medical Officer and his Staff won't be here for a fortnight.
         My orders against piecemeal occupation are specific. But <span class="unit">the 29th</span>
         Division is our  piece de resistance  and it won't be here, we
         reckon--not complete--for another three weeks.</p>
      
      
      <p>All the same, I might chance it, for, by taking all these off chances we
         might  pull off the main chance of stealing a march upon the Turks.
         What puts me off is not the chances of war but the certainties of
         commonsense. If I did so handle my troops on the spot as to sup on <span class="location">Achi
            Baba</span> to-morrow night, I still could not counter the inevitable reaction
         of numbers, time and space. The Turks would have at least a fortnight to
         concentrate their whole force against my half force; to defeat them and
         then to defy the other half.</p>
      
      
      <p>I must wait for the <span class="unit">29th Division</span>. By the time they come I can get
         things straight for a smashing simultaneous blow and I am resolved that,
         so far as in me lies, the orders and preparations will then be so
         thoroughly worked out--so carefully rehearsed as to give every chance to
         my men.[6]</p>
      
      
      <p>If the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> were here--or near at hand--I could balance
         shortage against the obvious evils of giving the Turks time to reinforce
         and to dig. Could I hope for the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> within a week it might be
         worth my while to fly in the face of <span class="person">K.</span> by grasping <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> firmly
         by her toe: or,--had my staff and self been here ten days ago, we could
         have already got well forward with our plans and orders, as well as with
         the laying of our hands upon the thousand odds and ends demanded by the
         invasion of a barren, trackless extremity of an Empire--odds and ends
         never thought of by anyone until the spur of reality brought them
         galloping to the front. Then the moment the Fleet cried off, we might
         have had a dash in, right away, with what we have here. The onslaught
         could have been supported from <span class="location">Egypt</span> and the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> might have
         been treated as a reserve.</p>
      
      
      <p>But, taking things as they are:--</p>
      
      
      <p>(1). No detail thought out, much less worked out or practised, as to
         form or manner of landing;</p>
      
      
      <p>(2). Absence of <span class="unit">29th Division</span>;</p>
      
      
      <p>(3). Lack of gear (naval and military) for any landing on a large scale
         or maintenance thereafter;</p>
      
      
      <p>(4). Unsettled weather; my ground is not solid enough to support me
         were I to put it to <span class="person">K.</span> that I had broken away from his explicit
         instructions.</p>
      
      
      <p>The Navy, i.e., <span class="person">de Robeck</span>, <span class="person">Wemyss</span> and <span class="person">Keyes</span>, entirely agree. They see as
         well as we do that the military force ought to have been ready before
         the Navy began to attack. What we have to do now is to repair a first
         false step. <span class="person">The Admiral</span> undertakes to keep pegging away at the Straits
         whilst we in <span class="location">Alexandria</span> are putting on our war paint. He will see to it,
         he says, that they think more of battleships than of landings. He is
         greatly relieved to hear  I  have practically made up my mind to go for
         the South of <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> and to keep in closest touch with the Fleet.
         <span class="person">The Commodore</span> also seems well pleased: he told us he hoped to get his
         Fleet Sweeps so reorganised as to do away with the danger from mines by
         the 3rd or 4th of April; then, he says, with us to do the spotting for
         the naval guns, the battleships can smother the Forts and will alarm the
         Turkish Infantry as to that tenderest part of an Army--its rear. So<span class="person"> I
            </span>may say that all are in full agreement,--a blessing.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have cabled home begging for more engineers, a lot of hand grenades,
         trench mortars, periscopes and tools. The barbed wire bothers me! Am
         specially keen about trench mortars; if it comes to close fighting on
         <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> with its restricted area trench mortars may make up for
         our lack of artillery and especially of howitzers. Luckily, they can be
         turned out quickly.</p>
      
      
      <p> 23rd March, 1915. <span class="location">H.M.S. "Franconia.</span>"  At 9 a.m. <span class="person">General d'Amade</span> and
         his Staff came aboard. <span class="person">D'Amade</span> had been kept yesterday by his own
         pressing business from attending the Conference. I have read him these
         notes and have shown him my cable of yesterday to Lord <span class="person">K.</span> in which I say
         that "The <span class="person">French Commander</span> is equally convinced that a move to
         <span class="location">Alexandria</span> is a practical necessity, although a point of honour makes it
         impossible for him to suggest turning his back to the Turks to his own
         Government." But, I say, "he will be enchanted if they give him the
         order." <span class="person">D'Amade</span> says I have not quite correctly represented his views.
         Not fantastic honour, he says, caused him to say we had better, for a
         while, hold on, but rather the sense of prestige. He thought the
         departure of the troops following so closely on the heels of the naval
         repulse would have a bad moral effect on the Balkans. But he agrees
         that, in practice, the move has now become imperative; the animals are
         dying; the men are overcrowded, whilst <span class="location">Mudros</span> is impossible as a base.
         My cable, therefore, may stand.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 10 o'clock <span class="person">he</span>, <span class="person">Birdie</span> and <span class="person">myself</span> landed to inspect a Battalion of
         Australians (<span class="unit">9th Battalion</span> of the <span class="unit">3rd Brigade</span>). I made them carry out a
         little attack on a row of windmills, and really, they did not show much
         more imagination over the business than did Don Quixote in a similar
         encounter. But the men are superb specimens.</p>
      
      
      <p>Some of the troop transports left harbour for <span class="location">Egypt</span> during the
         afternoon. Bad to see these transports sailing the wrong way. What a
         d----d pity! is what every soldier here feels--and says. But to look
         on the bright side, our fellows will be twice as well trained to boat
         work, and twice as well equipped by the time the <span class="unit">29th</span> turn up, and by
         then the weather will be more settled. As <span class="person">d'Amade</span> said too, it will be
         worth a great deal to us if the French troops get a chance of working a
         little over the ground together with their British comrades before they
         go shoulder to shoulder against the common enemy. All the same, if I had
         my men and guns handy, I'd rather get at the Turks quick than be sure of
         good weather and good  band-o-bast  and be sure also of a well-prepared
         enemy.</p>
      
      
      <p>In the afternoon <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> brought me a draft cable for Lord <span class="person">K.</span>  re 
         yesterday's Conference. I have approved. In it I say, "on the
         thoroughness with which I can make the preliminary arrangements, of
         which the proper allocation of troops, etc., to transports is not the
         least important, the success of my plans will largely depend."
         Therefore, I am going to <span class="location">Alexandria</span>, as a convenient place for this work
         and, "the Turks will be kept busy meanwhile by the <span class="person">Admiral</span>."</p>
      
      
      <p> 24th March, 1915. <span class="location">H.M.S. "Franconia</span>."  <span class="person">D'Amade</span> and Staff came aboard at
         10 a.m. He has got leave to move and will sail to <span class="location">Alexandria</span> forthwith.
         <span class="person">Roger Keyes</span> from the <span class="location">Flagship</span> came shortly afterward. He is sick as a
         she-bear robbed of her cubs that his pets: battleships, T.B.s,
         destroyers, submarines, etc., should have to wait for the Army. Well, we
         are not to blame! <span class="person">Keyes</span> has been shown my cables to <span class="person">K.</span> and is pleased
         with them. He accepts the fact, I think, that the Army must tackle the
         mobile artillery of the Turks before the Navy can expect to silence the
         light guns protecting the mine fields and then clear out the mines with
         the present type of mine sweeper. But the <span class="person">Admiral's</span> going to fix up the
         mine sweeper question while we are away. Once he has done that, Keyes
         believes the Fleet can knock out the Forts; wipe out the protective
         batteries and sweep up the mines quite comfortably. He said one
         illuminating and encouraging thing to <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>; viz., that he had
         never felt so possessed of the power of the Navy to force a passage
         through the Narrows as in the small hours of the 19th when he got back
         to the Flagship after trying in vain to salve the <span class="location"> Ocean </span> and the
         <span class="location"> Irresistible </span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Keyes brought me a first class letter from the Admiral--very much to the
         point:--</p>
      
      
      <p>                                                "<span class="location">H.M.S.  Q.E. </span>
         24th March, 15. </p>
      
      
      <p>  "My Dear General,</p>
      
      
      <p>"I hear the Authorities at 'Home' have been sending hastening telegrams
         to you. They most unfortunately did the same to us and probably if our
         work had been slower and more thorough it would have been better. If
         only they were on the  spot , they would realise that to hurry would
         write failure. In my very humble opinion, good co-operation and
         organisation means everything for the future. A great triumph is much
         better than scraping through and poor results! We are entirely with you
         and can be relied on to give any assistance in our power. We will not be
         idle!</p>
      
      
      <p>                             "Believe me,
         "Yours sincerely,
         ( Sd. ) "<span class="person">J.M. de Robeck</span>."</p>
      
      
      <p>11-15. <span class="person">Admiral Thursby</span> (just arrived with the <span class="location"> Queen </span> and <span class="location"> Implacable </span>)
         came to make his salaams. We served together at <span class="location">Malta</span> and both broke
         sinews in our calves playing lawn tennis--a bond of union.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have cabled to <span class="person">Lord K.</span> telling him I am just off to Alexandria. Have
         said that the ruling factor of my date of landing must be the arrival of
         the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> "(see para. 2 of your formal instructions to me the
         foresight of which appeals to me with double force now we are at close
         quarters with the problem[7])." I have pointed out that <span class="person">Birdwood's</span>
         Australians are very weak in artillery; that the <span class="unit">Naval Division</span> has none
         at all and that the guns of the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> make that body even more
         indispensable than he had probably realised. I would very much like to
         add that these are no times for infantry divisions minus artillery
         seeing that they ought to have three times the pre-war complement of
         guns, but <span class="person">Braithwaite's</span> good advice has prevailed. As promised at the
         Conference I express a hope that I may be allowed "to complete
         <span class="person">Birdwood's</span> <span class="unit">New Zealand Division</span> with a <span class="unit">Brigade of Gurkhas</span> who would work
         admirably in the terrain" of <span class="location">the Peninsula</span>. In view of what we have
         gathered from <span class="person">Keyes</span>, I wind up by saying, "The <span class="person">Admiral</span>, whose confidence
         in the Navy seems to have been raised even higher by recent events, and
         who is a thruster if ever there was one, is in agreement with this
         telegram."</p>
      
      
      <p>Actually <span class="person">Keyes</span> will show him a copy; we will wait one hour before
         sending it off and, if we don't hear then, we may take it <span class="person">de Robeck</span> will
         have endorsed the purport. Of course, if he does not agree the last
         sentence must come out, and he will have to put his own points to the
         Admiralty.</p>
      
      
      <p> Later .--Have sent Doughty Wylie to <span class="location">Athens</span> to do "Intelligence": the
         cable was approved by Navy; duly despatched; and now--up anchor!</p>

      <p>CHAPTER III EGYPT</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 25th March, 1915. <span class="location">H.M.S. "Franconia.</span>" At Sea.  A fine smooth sea and a
         flowing tide. Have written to <span class="person">K.</span> and <span class="person">Mr. Asquith</span>. Number two has caused
         me  fikr .[8] The <span class="person">P.M.</span> lives in another plane from us soldiers. So it
         came quite easily to his lips to ask  me  to write to him,--a high
         honour, likewise an order. But <span class="person">K.</span> is my soldier chief. As C.-in-C. in
         <span class="location">India</span> he refused point blank to write letters to autocratic John Morley
         behind the back of the Viceroy, and Morley never forgave him. <span class="person">K.</span> told me
         this himself and he told me also that he resented the correspondence
         which was, he knew, being carried on, behind his (<span class="person">K.</span>'s) back, between
         the army in <span class="location">France</span> and his (<span class="person">K.</span>'s) own <span class="person">political Boss</span>: that sort of
         action was, he considered, calculated to undermine authority.</p>
      
      
      <p>I have had a long talk with <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>  re  this quandary. He strongly
         holds that my first duty is to <span class="person">K.</span> and that it is for us a question of <span class="person">K.</span>
         and no one but <span class="person">K.</span> Were the S. of S. only a civilian (instead of being a
         Field Marshal) the case  might  admit of argument; as things are, it
         does not. So have written the <span class="person">P.M.</span> on these lines and shall send <span class="person">K.</span> the
         carbons of all my letters to him. To <span class="person">K.</span> himself I have written backing
         up my cable and begging for a <span class="unit">Brigade of Gurkhas</span>. Really, it is like
         going up to a tiger and asking for a small slice of venison: I remember
         only too well his warning not to make his position impossible by
         pressing for troops, etc., but <span class="location">Egypt</span> is not <span class="location">England</span>; the Westerners
         don't want the Gurkhas who are too short to fit into their trenches and,
         last but not least, our landing is not going to be the simple,
         row-as-you-please he once pictured. The situation in fact, is not in the
         least what he supposed it to be when I started; therefore, I am
         justified, I think, in making this appeal:--"I am very anxious, if
         possible, to get <span class="unit">a Brigade of Gurkhas</span>, so as to complete the New Zealand
         Divisional organisation with a type of man who will, I am certain, be
         most valuable on <span class="location">the Gallipoli Peninsula</span>. The scrubby hillsides on the
         South-west face of the plateau are just the sort of terrain where those
         little fellows are at their brilliant best. There is already a small
         Indian commissariat attached to the Mountain Batteries, so there would
         be no trouble on the score of supply."</p>
      
      
      <p>"As you may imagine, I have no wish to ask for anything the giving of
         which would seriously weaken our hold on <span class="location">Egypt</span>, but you will remember
         that four Mounted Brigades belonging to Birdwood's force are being left
         behind to look after the <span class="location">land of the Pharaohs</span>, and a <span class="unit">Mounted Brigade</span> for
         a battalion seems a fair exchange. <span class="location">Egypt</span>, in fact, so far as I can make
         out, seems stiff with troops, and each little Gurkha might be worth his
         full weight in gold at Gallipoli."</p>
      
      
      <p>Wrote Fitz in much the same sense:--"We are desperately keen to extract
         a <span class="unit">Gurkha Brigade</span> out of <span class="location">Egypt</span> and you might lend a hand, not only to us,
         but to all your own <span class="unit">Sikh</span> and <span class="unit">Dogra</span> Regiments, by making <span class="person">K.</span> see that the
         Indian Army was never given a dog's chance in the mudholes. They were
         benumbed:  it was not their show . Here, in the warm sun; pitted against
         the hereditary  dushman [9] who comes on shouting 'Allah!' they would
         gain much  izzat .[10]  Now mind , if you see any chance of an Indian
         contingent for <span class="location">Constantinople</span>, do everyone a good turn by rubbing these
         ideas into <span class="person">K.</span>"</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Braithwaite</span> has already picked up a number of useful hints from <span class="person">Roger
            Keyes</span>. His old friendship with <span class="person"> the Commodore</span> should be a help. <span class="person">Keyes</span> is
         a fine fellow; radiating resolve to do and vigour to carry
         through--hereditary qualities. His Mother, of whom he is an ugly
         likeness, was as high-spirited, fascinating, clever a creature as ever<span class="person"> I
            </span>saw. Camel riding, hawking, dancing, making good  band-o-bast  for a
         picnic, she was always at the top of the hunt; the idol of the Punjab
         Frontier Force. His Father, Sir Charles, grim old Paladin of the
         Marshes, whose loss of several fingers from a sword cut earned him my
         special boyish veneration, was really the devil of a fellow. My first
         flutter out of the sheltered nest of safe <span class="location">England</span> into the outer sphere
         of battle, murder and sudden death, took place under the auspices of
         that warrior so famoused in fight when I was aged twenty. Riding
         together in the early morning from the mud fort of Dera Ismail Khan
         towards the Mountain of Sheikh Budin, we suddenly barged into a mob of
         wild Waziri tribesmen who jumped out of the ditch and held us up--hand
         on bridle. The old General spoke Pushtu fluently, and there was a
         parley, begun by him, ordinarily the most silent of mankind. Where were
         they going to? To buy camels at Dera Ghazi Khan. How far had they come?
         Three days' march; but they had no money. The General simulated
         amazement--"You have come all that distance to buy camels without money?
         Those are strange tales you tell me. I fear when you pass through Dera
         Ismail you will have to raise the wind by selling your nice pistols and
         knives: oh yes, I see them quite well; they are peeping at me from under
         your poshteens." The Waziris laughed and took their hands off our reins.
         Instantly, the General shouted to me, "Come on--gallop!" And in less
         than no time we were going hell for leather along the lonely frontier
         road towards our next relay of horses. "That was a narrow squeak," said
         the General, "but  you may take liberties with a Waziri if only you can
         make him laugh ."</p>
      
      
      <p> 26th March, 1915. <span class="location">H.M.S. "Franconia</span>." At Sea.  Inspected troops on
         board. A keen, likely looking lot. All <span class="unit">Naval Division</span>; living monuments,
         these fellows, to <span class="person">Winston</span> Churchill's contempt for convention.</p>
      
      
      <p>Reached <span class="location">Port Said</span> about 3.30 p.m. Nipped into a "Special" which seems to
         have become my "ordinary" vehicle and left for <span class="location">Cairo</span>. Opened despatches
         from <span class="location">London</span>. "Bullet-proof lighters cannot be provided." "I quite agree
         that the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> with its artillery is necessary." Not a word
         about <span class="unit">the Gurkhas</span>. Arrived at 10 p.m., and was met by <span class="person">Maxwell</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p> 27th March, 1915 <span class="location">Cairo</span>.  Working hard at Headquarters all day till 6.15
         p.m., when I made my salaam to the <span class="person">Sultan</span> at the Abdin Palace. A real
         Generals' dinner--what we used to call a  burra khana --at <span class="person">Maxwell's</span>
         hospitable board:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  <span class="person">General Birdwood</span>,
         <span class="person">General Godley</span>,
         <span class="person">General Bridges</span>,
         <span class="person">General Douglas</span>,
         <span class="person">General Braithwaite</span>,
         <span class="person">Myself</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p> 28th March, 1915. <span class="location">Cairo</span>.  Inspected <span class="unit">East Lancashire Division</span> and a
         <span class="unit">Yeomanry Brigade</span> (Westminster Dragoons and Herts). How I envied <span class="person">Maxwell</span>
         these beautiful troops. They will only be eating their heads off here,
         with summer coming up and the desert getting as dry as a bone. <span class="unit">The
            Lancashire men</span> especially are eye-openers. How on earth have they
         managed to pick up the swank and devil-may-care airs of crack regulars?
         They  are  Regulars, only they are bigger, more effective specimens than
         Manchester mills or East Lancashire mines can spare us for the Regular
         Service in peace time. Anyway, no soldier need wish to see a finer lot.
         On them has descended the mantle of my old comrades[11] of
         Elandslaagte and Caesar's Camp, and worthily beyond doubt they will wear
         it.</p>
      
      <div class="Maxwell"><img src="images/John_Maxwell.jpg" alt="ya_4_people" width="535" height= "600"/>
         <p style="text-align:center">Lieut.-Gen. the Rt. Hon. Sir J. G. Maxwell, G.C.B., K.C.M.G.</p></div>
      
      <p>The enthusiasm of the natives was a pleasing part of the show. During
         four years of Egyptian Inspections I recall no single instance of any
         manifestation of friendliness to our troops, or even of interest in
         them, by Gyppies. But the Territorials seem, somehow, to have conquered
         their goodwill. As each stalwart company swung past there was a
         spontaneous effervescence of waving hands along the crowded street and
         murmurs of applause from Bedouins, Blacks and Fellaheen.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Maxwell</span> will have a fit if I ask for them! He will fall down in a fit, I
         am sure. Already he is vexed at my having cabled and written <span class="person">Lord K.</span> for
         his  (<span class="person">Maxwell's</span>) <span class="unit">Brigade of Gurkhas</span>. To him I appear careless of his
         (<span class="person">Maxwell's</span>) position and of the narrowness of his margin of safety. For
         the life of him <span class="person">K.</span> can't help putting his Lieutenants into this
         particular cart. The same old story as the eight small columns in the
         <span class="location">Western Transvaal</span>: co-equal and each thinking his own beat on the veldt
         the only critical spot in <span class="location">South Africa</span>: and the funny thing is that
         <span class="person">Maxwell</span> was then running the base at Vryberg and I was in command in the
         field! But  there  my word was law;  here  <span class="person">Maxwell</span> is entirely
         independent of me, which is as much as to say, that the feet are not
         under control of the head; i.e., that the expedition must move like a
         drunken man. That is my fear: <span class="person">Maxwell</span> will do what lies in him to help,
         but in action it is better to order than to ask.</p>
      
      
      <p>Grand lunch at the Abdin Palace with <span class="person">the Sultan</span>. Most of the Cabinet
         present. The <span class="person">Sultan</span> spoke French well and seems clever as well as most
         gracious and friendly. He assured me that the Turkish Forts at the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> were absolutely impregnable. The words "absolute" and
         "impregnable" don't impress me overmuch. They are only human opinions
         used to gloss over flaws in the human knowledge or will. Nothing is
         impregnable either--that's a sure thing. No reasons were given me by <span class="person">His
            Highness</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have just written home about these things: midnight.</p>
      
      
      <p> 29th March, 1915. 9.30 p.m. Palace Hotel, <span class="location">Alexandria</span>.  Early start to
         the Mena Camp to see the Australians. A devil of a blinding storm gave a
         foretaste of dust to dust. That was when they were marching past, but
         afterwards I inspected the Infantry at close quarters, taking a good
         look at each man and speaking to hundreds. Many had been at my
         inspections in their own country a year ago, but most were new hands who
         had never worn uniform till they 'listed for the war. The troops then
         marched back to Camp in mass of quarter columns--or rather swept by like
         a huge yellow cloud at the heart of which sparkled thousands of
         bayonets.</p>
      
      
      <p>Next I reviewed the Artillery, Engineers and Cavalry; winding up with
         the overhaul of the supply and transport column. This took time, and I
         inspect a mixed Division of Australians and New Zealanders at
         <span class="location">Heliopolis</span>. <span class="person">Godley</span> commanded. Great fun seeing him again. These fellows
         made a real good show; superb physique: numbers of old friends
         especially amongst the New Zealanders. Another scurry in the motor to
         catch the 4.15 for Alexandria. Tiring day if I had it in my mind to be
         tired, but this 30,000 crowd of <span class="person">Birdwood's</span> would straighten up the back
         of a pacifist. There is a bravery in their air--a keenness upon their
         clean cut features--they are spoiling for a scrap! Where they have
         sprung from it is hard to say. Not in <span class="location">Brisbane</span>, <span class="location">Adelaide</span>, <span class="location">Sydney</span>,
         <span class="location">Melbourne</span> or <span class="location">Perth</span>--no, nor in <span class="location">Dunedin</span>, <span class="location">Christchurch</span>, <span class="location">Wellington</span> or
         <span class="location">Auckland</span>, did I meet specimens like unto these. The spirit of War has
         breathed its fires into their hearts; the drill sergeant has taken
         thought and has added one cubit to their stature.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">D'Amade</span> has just been to make me known to a couple of Frenchmen about to
         join my Staff. They seem to be nice fellows. The French have been here
         some days and they are getting on well. <span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span> landed this
         morning; his first batch of transports are in the harbour. I am to see
         the French troops in four days' time; <span class="person">Hunter-Weston's</span> <span class="unit">29th Division</span> on
         the fifth day. Neither Commander has yet worked out how long it will
         take before he has reloaded his transports. They declare it takes three
         times as long to repack a ship loaded at haphazard as it would have
         taken to have loaded her on a system in the first instance. Six days per
         ship is their notion of what they can do, butI trust to improve a bit
         on that.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span> had written me a letter from <span class="location">Malta</span> (just to hand) putting
         it down in black and white that we have not a reasonable prospect of
         success. He seemed keen and sanguine when we met and made no reference
         to this letter: so it comes in now as rather a startler. But it is best
         to have the black points thrust upon one's notice beforehand--so long
         always as I keep it fixed in the back of my mind that there was never
         yet a great thought or a great deed which was not cried down as
         unreasonable before the fact by a number of reasonable people!</p>
      
      
      <p> 30th March, 1915. <span class="location">Alexandria</span>.  Have just dictated a long letter to Lord
         <span class="person">K.</span> in the course of which I have forced myself to say something which
         may cause the great man annoyance. I feel it is up to me to risk that.
         One thing--he knows I am not one of those rotters who ask for more than
         they can possibly be given so that, if things go wrong, they may
         complain of their tools. I have promised <span class="person">K.</span> to help him by keeping my
         demands down to bedrock necessities. I make no demand for ammunition on
         the <span class="location">France</span> and Flanders scale but--we must have  some ! There must be a
         depot somewhere within hail. Here is the crucial para.:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"I realise how hard up you must be for ammunition, but I hope the M.G.O.
         will have by now put in hand the building up of some reserves at our
         base in <span class="location">Alexandria</span>. If our batteries or battalions now serving in <span class="location">France</span>
         run short, something, at a pinch, can always be scraped together in
         <span class="location">England</span> and issued to them within 24 hours. Here it would be a question
         of almost as many days, and, if it were to turn out that we have a long
         and severe struggle, with no reserves nearer us than Woolwich--well--it
         would not be pleasant! Moreover the number of howitzers, guns and rifles
         in <span class="location">France</span> is so enormous that it is morally impossible they should all
         be hotly engaged at the same time. Thus they automatically form their
         own reserves. In other words, a force possessing only ten howitzers
         ought to have at least twice the reserves of a force possessing a
         hundred howitzers. So at least it seems to me."</p>
      
      
      <p>In the same letter I tell him about "<span class="person">Birdwood's</span> crowd" and of their
         splendid physique; their growing sense of discipline, their exceeding
         great keenness, and wind up by saying that, given a fair chance, they
         will, for certain, "render a very good account of themselves."</p>
      
      
      <p>Confabs with <span class="person">d'Amade</span> and <span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span>. <span class="person">Hunter-Weston's</span> "appreciation"
         of the situation at the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> is to be treated as an  ad interim 
         paper; he wrote it, he says now, without the fuller knowledge he is
         daily acquiring--knowledge which is tending to make him more sanguine.
         His stay at <span class="location">Malta</span> and his talks with Officers there had greatly
         impressed him with the hardness of the nut we have to try and crack; so
         much so that his paper suggests an indefinite putting off of the attempt
         to throw open the Straits.I asked him if he had laid his view before <span class="person">K.</span>
         in <span class="location">London</span> and he said, No; that he had not then come to it and that he
         had not definitely come to it now.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">D'Amade's</span> own inclinations would have led him to Asia. When he left
         <span class="location">France</span> he did not know he was to be under me and he had made up his mind
         to land at Adramiti. But now he waives all preconceived ideas and is
         keen to throw himself heart and soul into <span class="person">Lord K.'s</span> ideas and mine. He
         would rather I did not even refer to his former views as he sees they
         are expressly barred by the tenor of my instructions. The French are
         working to time in getting ship-shape. <span class="unit">The 29th Division</span> are arriving up
         to date and about one-third of them have landed. We are fixing up our
         gear for floating and other piers and are trying to improvise ways and
         means of coping with the water problem--this ugly nightmare of a water
         problem. The question of the carriage and storage of water for thousands
         of men and horses over a roadless, mainly waterless track of country
         should have been tackled before we left <span class="location">England</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>To solve these conundrums we have had to recreate for ourselves a
         special field service system of food, water and ammunition supply. As an
         instance we have had to re-organise baggage sections of trains and fit
         up store ships as substitutes for additional ammunition columns and
         parks. We are getting on fairly fast with our work of telling off troops
         to transports so that each boat load of men landed will be, so to say,
         on its own; victualled, watered and munitioned. But it takes some doing.
         Greatly handicapped by absence of any Administrative, or Q. Staff. The
         General Staff are working double shifts, at a task for which they have
         never been trained:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  It's a way we have in the Aaarmy!
         It's a way we have in the NAAAAvy!!
         It's a way we have in the Eeeeeempire!!!
         That nobody can deny!!!!</p>
      
      
      <p>What would my friends on the Japanese General Staff say--or my quondam
         friends on the German General Staff--if they knew that a
         Commander-in-Chief had been for a fortnight in touch with his troops,
         engaged with them upon a huge administrative job, and that he had not
         one administrative Staff Officer to help him, but was willynilly using
         his General Staff for the work? They would say "mad Englishmen" and this
         time they would be right. The British public services are poisoned by
         two enormous fallacies: ( a ) if a man does well in one business, he
         will do equally well or better in another; ( b ) if a man does badly in
         one business he will do equally badly or worse in another. There is
         nothing beyond a vague, floating reputation or public opinion to enable
         a new Minister to know his subordinates. The Germans have tabulated the
         experiences and deficiencies of our leaders, active and potential, in
         peace and war--we have not! Every British General of any note is
         analysed, characterised and turned inside out in the bureau records of
         the great German General Staff in Berlin. We only attempt anything of
         that sort with burglars. My own portrait is in those archives and is
         very good if not very flattering; so a German who had read it has told
         me. This is organisation: this is business; but official circles in
         <span class="location">England</span> are so remote in their methods from these particular notions of
         business that I must turn to a big newspaper shop to let anyone even
         begin to understand what it is to run Q. business with a G.S. team.
         Suppose <span class="person">Lord Northcliffe</span> decided to embark upon a journalistic campaign
         in Canada and that his scheme turned upon time; that it was a question
         of <span class="person">Northcliffe</span> catching time by the forelock or of time laying
         Northcliffe by the heels. Suppose, further, that he had no first-hand
         knowledge of Canada and had decided to place the conduct of the campaign
         in the hands of his brother who would spy out the land; choose the best
         site; buy a building; order the printing press; engage hands and start
         the paper. Well; what staff would he send with him? A couple of leader
         writers, a trio of special correspondents and half a dozen reporters?
         Probably; but would there not also be berths taken in the Cunarder for a
         manager trained in the business side of journalism? Quite a fair way of
         putting the present case, although, on the other side, it is also fair
         to add that British Officers have usually had to play so many parts in
         the charade of square pegs in round holes, that they can catch a hold
         anywhere, at any time, and carry on somehow.</p>
      
      
      <p> 31st March, 1915. <span class="location">Alexandria</span>. --Quill driving and dictating. Have made
         several remonstrances lately at the way <span class="person">McMahon</span> is permitting the
         Egyptian Press to betray our intentions, numbers, etc. It is almost
         incredible and <span class="person">Maxwell</span> doesn't see his way clear to interfere. For the
         last day or two they have been telling the Turks openly where we are
         bound for. Sohave written <span class="person">McMahon</span> the following:--</p>
      
      
      <p>                   "General Headquarters,
         "18 RUE EL CAIED GOHAR,
         "<span class="location">ALEXANDRIA</span>, 31/3/15.</p>
      
      
      <p>  "DEAR HIGH COMMISSIONER,</p>
      
      
      <p>"I was somewhat startled a couple of mornings ago by an article in the
         Egyptian Gazette  giving away the arrival of the French troops, and
         making open references to <span class="location">the Gallipoli Peninsula</span>. The very frankness of
         such communications may of course mislead the Turk into thinking we mean
         thereby to take his mind off some other place which is our real
         objective, butI doubt it. He knows our usual methods too well.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Consequently as it is very important at least to throw him into some
         state of bewilderment as to our movements, I propose sending the
         following cable to <span class="person">Lord Kitchener</span>:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"'Whether of set purpose or through inadvertence articles have appeared
         in Egyptian Press openly discussing arrival of French and British troops
         and naming Gallipoli as their destination. Is there any political
         objection to my cautiously spreading rumour that our true objective is,
         say, <span class="location">Smyrna</span>?'</p>
      
      
      <p>"Before I despatch the wire, however, I think I should like you to see
         it, in case you have any objections. I have all the facilities for
         spreading any rumour I like through my Intelligence Branch, which would
         be less suspected than information leaking out from political sources.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Could you kindly send me a wire on receipt of this?</p>
      
      
      <p>                                            "Yours sincerely,
         ( Sd. ) <span class="person">"IAN HAMILTON."</span></p>
      
      
      <p>"I only propose to ask <span class="person">Lord K.</span> in case there may be political reasons
         why I should not select any particular place about which to spread a
         rumour of our landing."</p>
      
      
      <p>Forgot to note a step taken yesterday--to nowhere perhaps--perhaps to
         <span class="location">Constantinople</span>. Yesterday the  Doris  brought me a copy of a long cable
         sent by <span class="person">Winston</span> to <span class="person">de Robeck</span> six days ago, together with a copy of the
         V.A.'s reply. <span class="person">The First Lord</span> is clearly in favour of the Fleet going on
         knocking the Forts to pieces whilst the Army are getting on with their
         preparations; clearly also he thinks that, under rough handling from
         <span class="location">Q.E.</span> and Co., the Turkish resistance might at any moment collapse. Then we
         should sail through as per<span class="person"> Lord K.'s</span>programme. Well; nothing would suit
         me so well. If we are to have an opposed landing better kill two birds
         with one stone and land bang upon the <span class="location">Bosphorus</span>. The nearer to the heart
         I can strike my first blow, the more telling it will be. Cable 140 puts
         the case very well. <span class="person">Winston</span> hits the nail on the head, so it seems to
         me, when he points out that the Navy is not tied to the apron strings of
         the Army but that it is the other way about: i.e., if the Fleet makes
         another big push whilst we are getting ready, they can still fall back
         on the combined show with us if they fail; whereas, if they succeed they
         will save us all the loss of life and energy implied by an opposed
         landing at the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>. Certainly <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> and I had understood
         that <span class="person">de Robeck</span> would work to that end; that this is what he was driving
         at when he said he would not be idle but would keep the Turks busy
         whilst we were getting ready. Nothing will induce me to volunteer
         opinions on Naval affairs. But <span class="person">de Robeck</span>'s reply to <span class="person">Winston</span> might be
         read as if I  had  expressed an opinion, so I am bound to clear up that
         point--definitely.</p>
      
      
      <p>  " From  <span class="person">GENERAL SIR IAN HAMILTON</span>.
         " To  <span class="person">VICE-ADMIRAL SIR JOHN DE ROBECK</span></p>
      
      
      <p>"Copy of number 140 from Admiralty received AAA I had already
         communicated outline of our plan to <span class="person">Lord Kitchener</span> and am pushing on
         preparations as fast as possible AAA War Office still seems to cherish
         hope that you may break through without landing troops AAA Therefore, as
         regards yourself I think wisest procedure will be to push on
         systematically though not recklessly in attack on Forts AAA It is always
         possible that opposition may crumple up AAA If you should succeed be
         sure to leave light cruisers enough to see me through my military attack
         in the event of that being after all necessary AAA If you do not succeed
         then I think we quite understand one another AAA

      <p> 1st April, 1915. <span class="location">Alexandria</span>.  <span class="location">The  Arcadian </span> has arrived bringing my
         A.G. and Q.M.G. with the second echelon of the Staff. God be praised for
         this immense relief! The General Staff can now turn to their legitimate
         business--the enemy, instead of struggling night and day with A.G. and
         Q.M.G. affairs; allocating troops and transports; preparing for water
         supply; tackling questions of procedure and discipline. We are all sorry
         for the Q. Staff who, through no fault of their own, have been late for
         the fair,  their  special fair, the preparation, and find the show is
         practically over. On paper at least, the Australians and New Zealanders
         and the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> are properly fixed up. We should begin embarking
         these formations within the next three days. After that will come <span class="unit">the
            Naval Division</span> from <span class="location">Port Said</span> and <span class="unit">the French Division</span> from here.</p>
      
      
      <p> 2nd April, 1915. <span class="location">Alexandria</span>.  Hard at it all day in office. Am leaving
         to-night by special train for Port Said to hurry things along.</p>
      
      
      <p>A cable in from the Foreign Office telling me that the Russian part of
         my force consists of a complete Army Corps under General
         Istomine--evidently War and Foreign Offices still work in watertight
         compartments!</p>
      
      
      <p>Left <span class="location">Alexandria</span> last night at 11 and came into <span class="location">Port Said</span> at dawn. After
         breakfast mounted an Arab charger which seems to have emerged out of the
         desert to meet my wishes just as do special trains and banquets: as if I
         wore on my finger the magic ring of the Arabian fairy tale: so I do I
         suppose, in the command it has pleased <span class="person">K.</span>, Imperial Grand Vizier, to
         bestow upon this humble but lively speck of dust. Mounting we cantered
         through the heavy sand towards the parade ground near the docks. Here,
         like a wall, stood <span class="person">Winston's</span> far-famed <span class="unit">Naval Division</span> drawn up in its
         battle array. <span class="person">General Paris</span> received me backed by Olivant and Staff.
         After my inspection <span class="unit">the Division</span> marched past, and marched past very
         well indeed, much better than they did when I saw them some months ago
         in Kent, although the sand was against them, muffling the stamp of feet
         which binds a Company together and telling unevenly on different parts
         of the line. Admiral Pierce and his Flag Captain, Burmeister, honoured
         the occasion: they were on foot and so, not to elevate the stature of
         the Army above that of the Senior Service, I took the salute dismounted.</p>
      
      
      <p>Next had a look round camp. Found things so, so. Saw <span class="person">Arthur Asquith</span> and
         <span class="person">Rupert Brooke</span> of the <span class="unit">Howe Battalion</span>, both sick, neither bad. Asked
         <span class="person">Brooke</span> to join my personal Staff, not as a fire insurance (seeing what
         happened to Ronnie Brooke at Elandslaagte and to Ava at Waggon Hill) but
         still as enabling me to keep an eye on the most distinguished of the
         Georgians. <span class="person">Young Brooke</span> replied, as a  preux chevalier  would naturally
         reply,--he realised the privileges he was foregoing, but he felt bound
         to do the landing shoulder-to-shoulder with his comrades. He looked
         extraordinarily handsome, quite a knightly presence, stretched out there
         on the sand with the only world that counts at his feet.</p>
      
      
      <p>Lunched on the <span class="location"> Franconia </span> and conversed with <span class="person">Lieutenant-Colonel
            Matthews</span> and <span class="person">Major Mewes</span> of the <span class="unit">Plymouth Battalion</span>; also with <span class="person">Major
            Palmer</span>. To see with your eyes; to hear with your ears; to touch with
         your fingers enables you to bring the truth home to yourself. Five
         minutes of that personal touch tells a man more than five weeks of
         report reading. In five minutes I gained from these Officers five times
         more knowledge about <span class="location">Sedd-el-Bahr</span> and<span class="location"> Kum Kale</span> than all their own bald
         despatches describing their own landings and cutting-out enterprises had
         given me. <span class="person">Paris'</span> account had not helped me much either, the reason being
         that it was not first hand,--was only so many words that he had
         heard,--was not what he had  felt . Now, I do really, at last and for
         the first time, realistically grasp the lie of the land and of the
         Turks. The prospect is not too rosy, but <span class="person">Wolfe</span>, I daresay, saw blue as
         he gazed over the water at his problem, without map or General Staff
         plan to help him. There lay Quebec; within cannon shot; but that enemy
         was thrice his strength; entrenched in a fortress--there they lay
         confident--a landing was "impossible!" But all things are possible--to
         faith. He had faith in Pitt; faith in his own bright particular star;
         faith in the British Fleet standing resolute at his back:--he launched
         his attack; he got badly beaten at the landing; he pulled himself
         together; he met a thousand and one mishaps and delays, and when, at the
         long last, he fell, he had the plum in his pocket.</p>
      
      
      <p>The Turks lie close within a few yards of the water's edge on the
         Peninsula. <span class="person">Matthews</span> smiled sarcastically at the War Office idea that no
         Turks can exist South of <span class="location">Achi Baba</span>! At <span class="location">Sedd-el-Bahr</span>, the first houses
         are empty, being open to the fire of the Fleet, but the best part of the
         other houses are defiladed by the ground and a month ago they were held.
         Glad I did not lose a minute after seeing the ground in asking <span class="person">Maxwell</span>
         and <span class="person">Methuen</span> to make me some trench mortars. <span class="person">Methuen</span> says he can't help,
         but <span class="person">Maxwell's</span> Ordnance people have already fixed up a sample or
         two--rough things, but better than nothing. We have too little shrapnel
         to be able to spare any for cutting entanglements. Trench mortars may
         help where the Fleet can't bring their guns to bear. The thought of all
         that barbed wire tucked away into the folds of the ground by the shore
         follows me about like my shadow.</p>
      
      
      <p>Left <span class="location">Port Said</span> for <span class="location">Kantara</span> and got there in half an hour. <span class="person">General Cox</span>,
         an old Indian friend of the days when I was A.D.C. to Sir Fred., met me
         at the station. He commands the Indian troops in <span class="location">Egypt</span>. We nipped into a
         launch on the Canal, and crossed over to inspect the Companies of the
         <span class="unit">Nelson</span>, <span class="unit">Drake</span>, <span class="unit">Howe</span> and <span class="unit">Anson</span> Battalions in their Fort, whilst <span class="person">Cox</span>
         hurried off to fix up a parade of his own.</p>

      <p><span class="unit">The Indian Brigade</span> were drawn up under <span class="person">Brigadier-General Mercer</span>. After
         inspection, the troops marched past headed by the band of the <span class="unit">14th
            Sikhs</span>. No one not a soldier can understand what it means to an old
         soldier who began fighting in the Afghan War under Roberts of Kandahar
         to be in touch once again with Sikhs and Gurkhas, those splendid
         knights-errant of India.</p>
      
      
      <p>After about eighteen years' silence, I thought my Hindustani would fail
         me, but the words seemed to drop down from Heaven on to my tongue. Am
         able now to understand the astonishment of St. Paul when he found
         himself jabbering nineteen to the dozen in lingo, Greek to him till
         then. But he at least was exempt from my worst terror which was that at
         any moment I might burst into German!</p>
      
      
      <p>After our little  durbar , the men were dismissed to their lines and I
         sounded (I had not told anyone of my intention) so the swift yet smooth
         fall-in to danger posts was a feather in <span class="person">Cox</span>'s helmet.</p>
      
      
      <p>Back to main camp and there saw troops not manning the Fort. There were
         the:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  Queen Victoria's Own
         <span class="unit">Sappers </span>                 <span class="person">Captain Hogg, R.E.</span>,

         and the Bikaner Camel
         Corps                                                  <span class="person">Major Bruce</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Had a second good talk to the Native Officers, shaking hands all round.
         Much struck with the turn-out of the <span class="unit">29th Mountain Battery</span> which is to
         come along with the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps to the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>From the platform of the Fort the lines of our defences and the way the
         Turks attacked them stood out very clearly to a pair of field glasses.
         Why, with so many mounted men some effort was not made to harry the
         enemy's retreat, <span class="person">Cox</span> cannot tell me. There were no trenches and the
         desert had no limits.</p>
      
      
      <p> Now  (in the train on my way back to <span class="location">Alexandria</span>) I must have one more
         try at <span class="person">K.</span> about these Gurkhas! My official cable and letter asking for
         <span class="unit">the Gurkha Brigade</span> have fallen upon stony ground. No notice of any sort
         has been vouchsafed to my modest request. Has  any  action been taken
         upon them? Possibly the matter has been referred to <span class="person">Maxwell</span> for opinion?
         If so, he has said nothing about it, which does not promise well. <span class="person">Cox</span>
         has heard nothing from <span class="location">Cairo</span>; only no end of camp rumours. Most likely
         <span class="person">K.</span> is vexed with me for asking for these troops at all, and thinks I am
         already forgetting his warning not to put him in the cart by asking for
         too many things. <span class="location">France</span> must not be made jealous and <span class="location">Egypt</span> ditto, I
         letter. The whole is  most  disappointing. Here is <span class="person">Cox</span> and here are his
         men, absolutely wasted and frightfully keen to come. There are the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> short-handed; there is the <span class="unit">New Zealand Division</span> short of a
         Brigade. If surplus and deficit had the same common denominator, say
         "<span class="person">K.</span>" or "G.S." they would wipe themselves out to the instant
         simplification of the problem. As it is, they are kept on separate
         sheets of paper;</p>
      
      
      <p>  too many troops        too few troops
         <span class="person">Maxwell</span>               <span class="person">Hamilton</span></p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>Have just finished dictating a letter to <span class="person">K.</span>, giving him an account of my
         inspection of the Indian troops and of how "they made my mouth water,
         especially the 6th Gurkhas." I ask him if I could not anyway have  them 
         "as a sort of escort to the <span class="unit">Mountain Battery</span>," and go on to say, "The
         desert is drying up, <span class="person">Cox</span> tells me; such water as there is is becoming
         more and more brackish and undrinkable; and no other serious raid, in
         his opinion, will be possible this summer." I might have added that once
         we open the ball at the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> the old Turks must dance to our
         tune, and draw in their troops for the defence of <span class="location">Constantinople</span> but it
         does not do to be too instructive to one's Grandmother. So there it is:
         I have done the best I can.</p>
      
      
      <p> 4th April, 1915. <span class="location">Alexandria</span>.  Busy day in office. Things beginning to
         hum. A marvellous case of "two great minds." <span class="person">K.</span> has proffered his advice
         upon the tactical problem, and how it should be dealt with, and, as I
         it in one, even down to details, only I have not shells enough to cut
         through barbed wire with my field guns or howitzers." I say also, "I
         should much like to have some hint as to my future supply of gun and
         rifle ammunition. <span class="unit">The Naval Division</span> has only 430 rounds per rifle and
         the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> only 500 rounds which means running it fine."</p>
      
      
      <p>What might seem, to a civilian, a marvellous case of coincidence or
         telepathy were he ever to compare my completed plan with <span class="person">K.</span>'s cabled
         suggestion is really one more instance of the identity of procedure born
         of a common doctrine between two soldiers who have worked a great deal
         together. Given the same facts the odds are in favour of these facts
         being seen eye to eye by each.</p>
      
      
      <p>Forgot to note that <span class="person">McMahon</span> answered my letter of the 31st personally,
         on the telephone, saying he had no objection to my cabling <span class="person">K.</span> or
         spreading any reports I liked through my Intelligence, but that he is
         not keeper of the  Egyptian Gazette  and must not quarrel with it as
         Egypt is not at war! No wonder he prefers the telephone to the telegram
         I begged him to send me if he makes these sort of answers. Egypt is in
         the war area and, if it were not, <span class="person">McMahon</span> can do anything he likes. The
         Gazette  continues to publish full details of our actions and my only
         hope is that the Turks will not be able to believe in folly so
         incredible.</p>
      
      
      <p> 5th April, 1915. <span class="location">Alexandria</span>.  Motored after early breakfast to French
         Headquarters at the Victoria College. Here I was met by <span class="person">d'Amade</span> and an
         escort of Cuirassiers, and, getting on to my Australian horse, trotted
         off to parade.</p>
      
      
      <p>Coming on to the ground, the French trumpeters blew a lively fanfare
         which was followed by a roll of drums. Never was so picturesque a
         parade, the verdict of one who can let his mind rove back through the
         military pageants of <span class="location">India</span>, <span class="location">Russia</span>, <span class="location">Japan</span>, <span class="location">Germany</span>, <span class="location">Austria</span>,
         <span class="location">Switzerland</span>, <span class="location">China</span>, <span class="location">Canada</span>, <span class="location">U.S.A.</span>, <span class="location">Australia</span>, and <span class="location">New Zealand</span>. Yes,
         <span class="location">Alexandria</span> has seen some pretty shows in its time; Cleopatra had an eye
         to effect and so, too, had the great Napoleon. But I doubt whether the
         townsfolk have ever seen anything to equal the  coup d'oeil  engineered
         by <span class="person">d'Amade</span>. Under an Eastern sun the colours of the French uniforms,
         gaudy in themselves, ran riot, and the troops had surely been posted by
         one who was an artist in more than soldiering. Where the yellow sand was
         broken by a number of small conical knolls with here and there a group,
         and here and there a line, of waving palms, there, on the knolls, were
         clustered the Mountain Batteries and the Batteries of Mitrailleuses. The
         Horse, Foot and Guns were drawn up, Infantry in front, Cavalry in rear,
         and the Field Artillery--the famous 75s--at right angles.</p>
      
      
      <p>Infantry of the Line in grey; Zouaves in blue and red; Senegalese wore
         dark blue and the Foreign Legion blue-grey. The Cavalry rode Arabs and
         barbs mostly white stallions; they wore pale blue tunics and bright
         scarlet breeches.</p>
      
      
      <p>I rode down the lines of Infantry first and then galloped through the
         heavy sand to the right of the Cavalry and inspected them, by <span class="person">d'Amade's</span>
         request, at a trot, winding up with the six Batteries of Artillery. On
         reaching the Saluting Base, I was introduced to the French Minister
         whilst <span class="person">d'Amade</span> presented colours to two Regiments (<span class="unit">175th Regiment de
            marche d'Afrique</span> and the <span class="unit">4th Colonial Regiment</span>) making a short and
         eloquent speech.</p>
      
      
      <p>He then took command of the parade and marched past me at the head of
         his forces. Were all the Houris of Paradise waving lily hands on the one
         side, and were these French soldiers on the other side, I would give my
         cold shoulder to the Houris.</p>
      
      
      <p>The Cavalry swung along at the trot to the cadence of the trumpets and
         to the clink-clank and glitter of steel. The beautiful, high-stepping
         barbs; the trembling of the earth beneath their hoofs; the banner
         streaming; the swordsmen of <span class="location">France</span> sweeping past the saluting base;
         breaking into the gallop; sounding the charge; charging;  ventre a
         terre ; out into the desert where, in an instant, they were snatched
         from our sight and changed into a pillar of dust!</p>
      
      
      <p>High, high soared our hopes. <span class="location">Jerusalem</span>--<span class="location">Constantinople</span>? No limit to what
         these soldiers may achieve. The thought passed through the massed
         spectators and set enthusiasm coursing through their veins. Loudly they
         cheered; hats off; and hurrah for the Infantry! Hurrah, hurrah for the
         Cavalry!! Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah for the 75s!!!</p>
      
      
      <p>At the end I said a few farewell words to the French Minister and then
         galloped off with <span class="person">d'Amade</span>. The bystanders gave us, too, the warmest
         greetings, the bulk of them (French and Greek) calling out <span class="person">"d'Amade!"</span>
         and the Britishers also shouting all sorts of things at the pitch of
         their voices.</p>
      
      
      <p>Almost lost my temper with <span class="person">Woodward</span>, my new A.G., and this was the
         thusness thereof:--</p>
      
      
      <p>Time presses: <span class="person">K.</span> prods us from the rear: the Admiral from the front. To
         their eyes we seem to be dallying amidst the fleshpots of Egypt whereas,
         really, we are struggling like drowning mariners in a sea of chaos;
         chaos in the offices; chaos on the ships; chaos in the camps; chaos
         along the wharves; chaos half seas over rolling down the Seven Sisters
         Road. The powers of <span class="person">Maxwell</span> as C.-in-C., Egypt; of the <span class="person">Sultan</span> and
         <span class="person">McMahon</span>, High Commissioner of Egypt, and of myself, C.-in-C., M.E.F.,
         not to speak of the powers of our police civil and military, have all to
         be defined and wheeled into line. We cannot go rushing off into space
         leaving Pandemonium behind us as our Base! I know these things from a
         very long experience. <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> believes in the principle as a student
         and ex-teacher of students. And yet that call to the front!</p>
      
      
      <p>We've  got  to tackle the landing scheme on the spot and quick. Luckily
         the problems at <span class="location">Alexandria</span> are  all  non-tactical; pure A.G. and Q.M.G.
         Staff questions; whereas, at present, the problems awaiting me at the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> are mainly tactical; G.S. questions. So I am going to treat
         G.H.Q. as Solomon threatened to treat the baby; i.e., leave the
         Administrative Staff here until they knock their pidgin more or less
         into shape and send off the G.S. to pluck  their  pidgin at the Straits.
         The Q. people have still to commandeer offices for <span class="person">Woodward</span>'s men, three
         quarters of whom stay here permanently to do the casualty work; they
         have to formulate a local code of discipline; take up buildings for base
         hospitals and arrange for their personnel and equipment; outline their
         schemes for getting sick and wounded back from the front; finish up the
         loading of the ships, etc., etc., etc.,  ad infinitum . Whilst the Q.
         Staff are thus pulling their full weight, the G. Staff will sail off
         quickly and put their heads together with the Admiral and his Staff. As
         to myself, I'm off: I cannot afford to lose more time in getting into
         touch with the sailors, and the scene of action.</p>
      
      
      <p>All was well until the Commander-in-Chief said he was going, but that
         moment arose the good old trouble--the trouble which muddled our start
         for the Relief of Chitral and ruined the Tirah Campaign. Everyone wants
         to rush off to the excitement of the firing line--(a spasm usually cured
         by the first hard fight), and to leave the hum-drum business of the Base
         and Line of Communication to shift for itself. <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>, of all
         people, was good natured enough to plead for the Administration. He came
         to tell me that it might tend towards goodwill amongst the charmed
         circle of G.H.Q. if even now, at the eleventh hour, I would sweeten
         <span class="person">Woodward</span> by bringing him along. I said, yes, if he, <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>, would
         stand surety that he, <span class="person">Woodward</span>, had fixed up his base hospitals and
         third echelon, but if not, no! Next came <span class="person">Woodward</span> himself. With great
         pertinacity he represented that his subordinates could do all that had
         to be done at the base. He says he speaks for the Q.M.G., as well as for
         the Director General of Medical Services, and that they all want to
         accompany me on my reconnaissance of the coasts of <span class="location">the Peninsula</span>. I was
         a little sharp with him. These heads of Departments think they must be
         sitting in the C.-in-C.'s pocket lest they lose caste. But I say the
         Departments must be where their work lies, or else the C.-in-C. will
         lose caste, and luckily he can still put his own Staff where he will.
         Finally, I agreed to take with me the Assistant to the Director of
         Medical Services to advise his own Chief as to the local bearings of his
         scheme for clearing out the sick and wounded; the others stay here until
         they get their several shows into working order, and with that my A.G.
         had fain to be content.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">D'Amade</span> and two or three Frenchmen are dining with me to-night. Sir John
         <span class="person">Maxwell</span> has just arrived.</p>
      
      
      <p> 6th April, 1915. <span class="location">Alexandria</span>.  Started out at 9.15 with d'Amade and Sir
         John to review the Mounted troops of the <span class="unit">29th Division</span>. We first saw
         them march down the road in column of route. What a contrast between
         these solid looking men on their magnificent weight-carrying horses and
         our wiry little Allies on their barbs and Arabs. The R.H.A. were superb.</p>
      
      
      <p>After seeing the troops I motored to Mex Camp and inspected the <span class="unit">86th</span> and
         <span class="unit">87th Infantry Brigades</span>. There was a strong wind blowing which tried to
         spoil the show, but could not--that Infantry was too superb! Alexander,
         Hannibal, Caesar, Napoleon; not one of them had the handling of
         legionaries like these. <span class="unit">The Fusilier Brigade</span> were the heavier. If we
         don't win, I won't be able to put it on the men.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Maxwell</span> left at 4 p.m. for <span class="location">Cairo</span>. I have pressed him hard about <span class="person">Cox</span>'s
         <span class="unit">Indian Brigade</span> and told him of my conversation with <span class="person">Cox</span> himself and of
         how keen all ranks of the <span class="unit">Brigade</span> are to come. No use. He expects, so he
         says, a big attack on <span class="location">the Canal</span> any moment; he has heard nothing from
         <span class="person">K.</span>; the fact that <span class="person">K.</span> has ignored my direct appeal to him shows he would
         not approve, etc., etc., etc. All this is just the line I myself would
         probably take--I admit it--if asked by another General to part with my
         troops. The arrangement whereby I have to sponge on <span class="person">Maxwell</span> for men if<span class="person"> I
            </span>want them is a detestable arrangement. At the last he consented to cable
         <span class="person">K.</span> direct on the point himself and then he is to let me know. Two things
         are quite certain; <span class="unit">the Brigade</span> are not wanted in <span class="location">Egypt</span>. Old campaigners
         versed in Egyptian war lore tell me that the drying up of the wells must
         put the lid on to any move across the desert until the winter rains,
         and, apart from this, how in the name of the beard of their own false
         prophet can the Turks attack <span class="location">Egypt</span> whilst we are at the gates of
         <span class="location">Constantinople</span>?</p>
      
      
      <p>But if the Brigade are not wanted on the Canal, we are bound to be the
         better for them at the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>, whatever course matters there may
         take. Concentration is the cue! The German or Japanese General Staffs
         would tumble to these truths and act upon them presto. <span class="person">K.</span> sees them too,
         but nothing can overcome his passion for playing off one Commander
         against another, whereby <span class="person">K.</span> of <span class="person">K.</span> keeps all reins in his hands and
         remains sole arbiter between them.</p>
      
      
      <p>Birdwood has just turned up. We're off to-morrow evening.</p>
      
      
      <p>'Phoned Maxwell last thing telling him to be sure not to forget to jog
         <span class="person">K.</span>'s elbow about <span class="person">Cox</span> and his Gurkhas.</p>
      
      
      <p> 7th April, 1915. <span class="location">S.S. "Arcadian"</span> 10 p.m.  <span class="person">D'Amade</span> looked in to say
         good-bye.</p>
      
      
      <p>On my way down to the harbour I overhauled the Assyrian Jewish Refugee
         Mule Corps at the Wardian Camp. Their Commander, author of that
         thrilling shocker, "The Man-killers of Tsavo," finds Assyrians and mules
         rather a mouthful and is going to tabloid bipeds and quadrupeds into
         "The Zion Corps." The mules look very fit; so do the Assyrians and,
         although I did not notice that their cohorts were gleaming with purple
         or gold, they may help us to those habiliments: they may, in fact, serve
         as ground bait to entice the big Jew journalists and bankers towards our
         cause; the former will lend us the colour, the latter the coin. Anyway,
         so far as I can, I mean to give the chosen people a chance.</p>
      
      
      <p>Got aboard at 5.15, but owing to some hitch in the arrangements for
         filling up our tanks with fresh water, we are held up and won't get off
         until to-morrow morning.</p>
      
      
      <p>If there drops a gnat into the ointment of the General, be sure there
         are ten thousand flies stinking the ointment of the troops.</p>
      
      
      <p> 8th April, 1915. <span class="location">S.S. "Arcadian</span>."  Sailing free to the Northwards. A
         fine day and a smooth sea. What would not Richard Coeur de Lion or
         Napoleon have given for the <span class="location"> Arcadian </span> to take them to St. Jean d'Acre
         and <span class="location">Jerusalem</span>?</p>
      
      
      <p>As we were clearing harbour a letter was brought out to us by a launch:</p>
      
      
      <p>                                                       "UNION CLUB,
         "<span class="location">ALEXANDRIA</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The following telephone received from General Maxwell, Cairo:--Your
         message re <span class="person">Cox</span>, I will do my best to meet your wishes. Will you in your
         turn assist me in getting the seaplanes arriving here in  Ganges ?<span class="person"> I

      <p>Cutlet for cutlet! I wish it had occurred to me sooner to do a deal with
         some aeroplanes. But, then I have none. No matter: I should have
         promised him <span class="person">de Robeck</span>'s! South Africa repeats itself! Egypt and Mudros

      <p>CHAPTER IV CLEARING FOR ACTION</p>
      
      
      <p> 9th April, 1915. <span class="location">S.S. "Arcadian</span>."  Isles of the Aegean; one more lovely
         than the other; weather warm; wireless off; a great ship steaming fast
         towards a great adventure--why do I walk up and down the deck feeling a
         ton's weight of trouble weighing down upon my shoulders? Never till
         to-day has solicitude become painful. This is the fault of Birdwood,
         Hunter-Weston and Paris. I read their "appreciations of the situation"
         some days ago, but until to-day I have not had the unbroken hour needed
         to digest them. Birdwood begins by excusing himself in advance against
         any charge of vacillation. At our first meeting he said he was convinced
         our best plan would be to go for the South of <span class="location">the Gallipoli Peninsula</span>.
         Now he has, in fact, very much shifted his ground under the influence of
         a new consideration, "(which I only learned after leaving <span class="location">Lemnos</span>) that
         the Turks now have guns or howitzers on the Asiatic side which could
         actually command our transports should they anchor off <span class="location">Morto Bay</span>." "As<span class="person"> I
            </span>told you," he says, "after thinking it out thoroughly, I was convinced
         our best plan would be to go for the South of <span class="location">the Gallipoli Peninsula</span>,"
         but now he continues, he finds his Staff "all seem to be keen on a
         landing somewhere between <span class="location">Saros Bay</span> and Enos. For this I have no use, as
         though I think we should doubtless be able to effect a landing there
         pretty easily, yet I do not see that we shall be any 'forrarder' by
         doing so. We might put ourselves in front of the <span class="location">Bulair</span> Lines, but there
         would be far less object in attacking them and working South-west with
         the Navy only partially able to help us, than by working up from the
         other end with the Navy on either flank."</p>
      
      
      <p>Birdwood himself rather inclines towards a landing on the Asiatic side,
         for preference somewhere South of <span class="location">Tenedos</span>. The attractive part of his
         idea is that if we did this the Turks must withdraw most of their mobile
         artillery from <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> to meet us, which would give the Navy just
         the opportunity they require for mine-sweeping and so forcing the
         Narrows forthwith. They know they can give the superstition of old Forts
         being stronger than new ships its quietus if only they can clear a
         passage through the minefield. There are forts and forts, ships and
         ships, no doubt. But from what we have done already the sailors know
         that our ships here can knock out those forts here. But first they must
         tackle the light guns which protect the minefield from the sweepers.
         Birdwood seems to think we might dominate <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> from the country
         round Chunuk. In his P.S. he suggests that anyway, if we are beaten off
         in our attempt to land on <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> we may have this Asiatic scheme
         in our mind as a second string. Disembarkation plans already made would
         "probably be suitable  anywhere  with very slight modifications. We
         might perhaps even think of this--if we try the other first and can't
         pull it off?"</p>
      
      
      <p>In my answer, I say I am still for taking the shortest, most direct
         route to my objective, the Narrows.</p>
      
      
      <p>First, because "I have no roving commission to conquer Asia Minor." My
         instructions deny me the whole of that country when they lay down as a
         principle that "The occupation of the Asiatic side by military forces is
         to be strongly deprecated."</p>
      
      
      <p>Secondly, because I agree that a landing between <span class="location">Saros Bay</span> and Enos
         would leave us no "forrarder." There we should be attacked in front from
         Rodosto; in flank from Adrianople; in rear from <span class="location">Bulair</span>; whilst, as we
         advanced, we would lose touch with the Fleet. But if our scheme is to be
         based on severance from the Fleet we must delay another month or six
         weeks to collect pack transport.</p>
      
      
      <p>Thirdly, the Asiatic side  does not  dominate <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> whereas the
         <span class="location">Kilid Bahr plateau</span>   does  dominate the Asiatic narrows.</p>
      
      
      <p>Fourthly, the whole point of our being here is to work hand-in-glove
         with the Fleet. We are here to help get the Fleet through the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> in the first instance and to help the Russians to take
         <span class="location">Constantinople</span> in the second. The War Office, the Admiralty, the
         Vice-Admiral and the French Commander-in-Chief all agree now that the
         Peninsula is the best place for our first step towards these objects.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Hunter-Weston's</span> appreciation, written on his way out at Malta, is a
         masterly piece of work. He understands clearly that our true objective
         is to let our warships through the Narrows to attack <span class="location">Constantinople</span>.
         "The immediate object," he says, "of operations in the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> is to
         enable our warships, with the necessary colliers and other unarmoured
         supply ships--without which capital ships cannot maintain themselves--to
         pass through the Straits in order to attack <span class="location">Constantinople</span>."</p>
      
      
      <p>And again:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"It is evident that land operations at this stage must be directed
         entirely towards assisting the Fleet; and no operations should be
         commenced unless it is clear that their result will be to enable our
         warships, with their necessary colliers, etc., to have the use of the
         Straits."</p>
      
      
      <p>The Fleet, he holds, cannot do this without our help because of:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  (1). Improvement of the defences.
         (2). The mobile howitzers.
         (3). The Leon floating mines.</p>
      
      
      <p>Things being so, he sets himself to consider how far the Army can help,
         in the light of the following premises:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"The Turkish Army having been warned by our early bombardments and by
         the landings carried out some time ago, has concentrated a large force
         in and near <span class="location">the Gallipoli Peninsula</span>."</p>
      
      
      <p>"It has converted <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> into an entrenched camp, has, under
         German direction, made several lines of entrenchments covering the
         landing places, with concealed machine gun emplacements and land mines
         on the beach; and has put in concealed positions guns and howitzers
         capable of covering the landing places and approaches with their fire."</p>
      
      
      <p>"The Turkish Army in <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> is being supplied and reinforced from
         the Asiatic side and from the Sea of Marmora and is not dependent on the
         Isthmus of <span class="location">Bulair</span>. The passage of the Isthmus of <span class="location">Bulair</span> by troops and
         supplies at night cannot be denied by the guns of our Fleet."</p>
      
      
      <p>After estimates of our forces and of the difficulties they may expect to
         encounter, Hunter-Weston comes to the conclusion that, "the only landing
         places worth serious consideration are:</p>
      
      
      <p>  "(1). Those near Cape Suvla,
         (2). Those near <span class="location">Cape Helles</span>."</p>
      
      
      <p>Of these two he advises <span class="location">Helles</span>, because:--"the Fleet can also surround
         this end of <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> and bring a concentrated fire on any Turks
         holding it. We, therefore, should be able to make sure of securing the
         <span class="location">Achi Baba</span> position." Also, because our force is too weak to hold the big
         country round <span class="location">Suvla Bay</span> and at the same time operate against <span class="location">Kilid Bahr</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>If this landing at <span class="location">Helles</span> is successful, he considers the probable
         further course of the operations. Broadly, he thinks that we are so
         short of ammunition and particularly of high explosive shell that there
         is every prospect of our getting tied up on an extended line across the
         Peninsula in front of the <span class="location">Kilid Bahr</span> trenches. Should the enemy
         submarines arrive we should be "up a tree."</p>
      
      
      <p>The cards in the game of life are the characters of men. Staking on
         those cards I take my own opinions--always. But when we play the game of
         death, things are our counters--guns, rivers, shells, bread, roads,
         forests, ships--and in totting up the values of these my friend
         Hunter-Weston has very few equals in the Army.</p>
      
      
      <p>Therefore, his conclusion depresses me very much, but not so much as it
         would have done had I not seen him. For certainly during his conference
         on the 30th March with <span class="person">d'Amade</span> and myself he never said or implied in
         any way that under conditions as he found them and as they were then set
         before him, there was no reasonable prospect of success:--quite the
         contrary. Here are the conclusions as written at Malta:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"Conclusion. The information available goes to show that if this
         Expedition had been carefully and secretly prepared in <span class="location">England</span>, <span class="location">France</span>
         and <span class="location">Egypt</span>, and the Naval and Military details of organisation, equipment
         and disembarkation carefully worked out by the General Staff and the
         Naval War Staff, and if no bombardment or other warning had been given
         till the troops, landing gear, etc., were all ready and despatched, (the
         troops from <span class="location">England</span> ostensibly for service in <span class="location">Egypt</span> and those in <span class="location">Egypt</span>
         ostensibly for service in <span class="location">France</span>) the capture of the Gallipoli
         Peninsula and the forcing of the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> would have been successful.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Von der Goltz is reported to have visited the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> on 11th
         February and before that date it appears that very little had been done.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Now big guns have been brought from <span class="location">Chatalja</span>, <span class="location">Adrianople</span> and
         elsewhere,--roads have been made,--heavy movable armaments
         provided,--troops and machine guns have been poured into the
         Peninsula,--several lines of trenches have been dug,--every landing
         place has been trenched and mined, and all that clever German Officers
         under Von der Goltz can design, and hard working diggers like the Turks
         can carry out, has been done to make <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> impregnable.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The prizes of success in this Expedition are very great.</p>
      
      
      <p>"It was indeed the most hopeful method of finishing the war.</p>
      
      
      <p>"No loss would be too heavy and no risks too great if thereby success
         would be attained.</p>
      
      
      <p>"But if the views expressed in this paper be sound, there is not in
         present circumstances a reasonable chance of success. (The views are
         founded on the information available to the writer at the time of
         leaving <span class="location">Malta</span>, and may be modified by further information at first hand
         on arrival at Force Head Quarters.)</p>
      
      
      <p>"The return of the Expedition when it has gone so far will cause
         discontent, much talk, and some laughter; will confirm Roumania and
         Greece in the wisdom of their neutrality, and will impair the power of
         our valuable friend M. Venezelos. It will be a heavy blow to all of us
         soldiers, and will need great strength and moral courage on the part of
         the Commander and Government.</p>
      
      
      <p>"But it will not do irreparable harm to our cause, whereas to attempt a
         landing and fail to secure a passage through the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> would be a
         disaster to the Empire.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The threat of invasion by the Allies is evidently having considerable
         effect on the Balkan States.</p>
      
      
      <p>"It is therefore advisable to continue our preparations;--to train our
         troops for landing, and to get our expedition properly equipped and
         organised for this difficult operation of war; so as to be ready to take
         advantage of any opportunity for successful action that may occur.</p>
      
      
      <p>"But I would repeat; no action should be taken unless it has been
         carefully thought out in all its possibilities and details and unless
         there is a reasonable  probability  of success.</p>
      
      
      <p>                                              "<span class="person">A. HUNTER-WESTON, M.G.</span>"</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Paris's</span> appreciation gives no very clear lead. "The enemy is of strength
         unknown," he says, "but within striking distance there must be 250,000."
         He also lays stress on the point that the enemy are expecting
         us--"Surprise is now impossible--.... The difficulties are now increased
         a hundredfold.... To land would be difficult enough if surprise was
         possible but hazardous in the extreme under present conditions." He
         discusses <span class="location">Gaba Tepe</span> as a landing place; also <span class="location">Smyrna</span>, and <span class="location">Bulair</span>. On the
         whole, he favours <span class="location">Sedd-el-Bahr</span> as it "is the only place where transports
         could come in close and where the actual landing may be unopposed. It is
         open to question whether a landing could be effected elsewhere. With the
         aid of the Fleet it may be possible to land near <span class="location">Cape Helles</span> almost
         unopposed and an advance of ten miles would enormously facilitate the
         landing of the remainder South of <span class="location">Gaba Tepe</span>."</p>
      
      
      <p>The truth is, every one of these fellows agrees in his heart with old
         Von der Goltz, the Berlin experts, and the <span class="person">Sultan of Egypt</span> that the
         landing is impossible. Well, we shall see, D.V., we shall see!! One
         thing is certain: we must work up our preparations to the  n th degree
         of perfection: the impossible can only be overborne by the
         unprecedented; i.e., by an original method or idea.</p>
      
      
      <p> 10th April, 1915. <span class="location">S.S. "Arcadian</span>." <span class="location">Lemnos</span>.  Cast anchor at 7 a.m. After
         breakfast went on board the  Queen Elizabeth  where <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> and<span class="person"> I
            </span>worked for three hours with <span class="person">Admiral de Robeck</span>, Admiral Wemyss and
         <span class="person">Commodore Roger Keyes</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Last time <span class="person">the Admiral</span> made the running; to-day it was my turn for I had
         to unfold my scheme and go through it point by point with the sailors.
         But first I felt it my duty to read out the appreciations of
         Hunter-Weston, Birdwood and Paris. Then I gave them my own view that
         history had never offered any nation so clean cut a chance of bringing
         off an immeasurably big coup as she had done by putting our Fleet and
         Army precisely where it was at present on the map of the war world. Half
         that unique chance had already been muddled away by the lack of secrecy
         and swiftness in our methods. With check mate within our grasp we had
         given two moves to the enemy. Still, perhaps; nay, probably, there was
         time. Were we to prolong hesitation, or, were we, now that we had done
         the best we could with the means under our hands, to go boldly forward?
         Here was the great issue: there was no use discussing detail until the
         principle was settled. By God's mercy the <span class="person">Vice-Admiral</span>, <span class="person">Wemyss</span> and <span class="person">Keyes</span>
         were all quite clear and quite determined. They rejected <span class="location">Bulair</span>; they
         rejected Asia; most of all they spurned the thought of further delay or
         of hanging about hoping for something to turn up.</p>
      
      
      <p>So I then told them my plan. The more, I said, I had pondered over the
         map and reflected upon the character, probable numbers and supposed
         positions of the enemy, the more convinced I had become that the first
         and foremost step towards a victorious landing was to upset the
         equilibrium of Liman von Sanders, the enemy Commander who has succeeded
         Djavad in the Command of the Fifth Army. I must try to move so that he
         should be unable to concentrate either his mind or his men against us.
         Here I was handicapped by having no knowledge of my opponent whereas the
         German General Staff is certain to have transferred the "life-like
         picture" Schroeder told me they had of me to <span class="location">Constantinople</span>. Still, sea
         power and the mobility it confers is a great help, and we ought to be
         able to rattle the enemy however imperturbable may be his nature and
         whatever he knows about us if we throw every man we can carry in our
         small craft in one simultaneous rush against selected points, whilst
         using all the balance in feints against other likely places. Prudence
         here is entirely out of place. There will be and can be no
         reconnaissance, no half measures, no tentatives. Several cautious
         proposals have been set before me but this is neither the time nor the
         place for paddling about the shore putting one foot on to the beaches
         with the idea of drawing it back again if it happens to alight upon a
         land mine. No; we've got to take a good run at <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> and jump
         plump on--both feet together. At a given moment we must plunge and stake
         everything on the one hazard.</p>
      
      
      <p>I would like to land my whole force in one,--like a hammer stroke--with
         the fullest violence of its mass effect--as close as I can to my
         objective, the <span class="location">Kilid Bahr plateau</span> . But, apart from lack of small craft,
         the thing cannot be done; the beach space is so cramped that the men and
         their stores could not be put ashore. I have to separate my forces and
         the effect of momentum, which cannot be produced by cohesion, must be
         reproduced by the simultaneous nature of the movement. From the South,
         <span class="location">Achi Baba</span> mountain is our first point of attack, and the direct move
         against it will start from the beaches at <span class="location">Cape Helles</span> and <span class="location">Sedd-el-Bahr</span>.
         As it is believed that the Turks are there in some force to oppose us,
         envelopment will be attempted by landing detachments in <span class="location">Morto Bay</span> and
         opposite <span class="location">Krithia</span> village. At the same time, also, the A. and N.Z. Corps
         will land between <span class="location">Gaba Tepe</span> and Fisherman's Hut to try and seize the
         high backbone of <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> and cut the line of retreat of the enemy
         on the <span class="location">Kilid Bahr plateau</span>. In any case, the move is bound to interfere
         with the movements of Turkish reinforcements towards the toe of the
         Peninsula. While these real attacks are taking place upon the foot and
         at the waist of <span class="location">the Peninsula</span>, the knife will be flourished at its neck.
         Transports containing troops which cannot be landed during the first two
         days must sail up to <span class="location">Bulair</span>; make as much splash as they can with their
         small boats and try to provide matter for alarm wires to <span class="location">Constantinople</span>
         and the enemy's Chief.</p>
      
      
      <p>So much for Europe. Asia is forbidden but I hold myself free, as a
         measure of battle tactics, to take half a step Troywards. The French are
         to land a Brigade at<span class="location"> Kum Kale</span> (perhaps a Regiment may do) so as, first,
         to draw the fire of any enemy big guns which can range <span class="location">Morto Bay</span>;
         secondly, to prevent Turkish troops being shipped across the Narrows.</p>
      
      
      <p>With luck, then, within the space of an hour, the enemy Chief will be
         beset by a series of S.O.S. signals. Over an area of 100 miles, from
         five or six places; from <span class="location">Krithia</span> and <span class="location">Morto Bay</span>; from <span class="location">Gaba Tepe</span>; from
         <span class="location">Bulair</span> and from<span class="location"> Kum Kale</span> in Asia, as well as, if the French can manage
         it, from <span class="location">Besika Bay</span>, the cables will pour in. I reckon Liman von
         Sanders will not dare concentrate and that he will fight with his local
         troops only for the first forty-eight hours. But what is the number of
         these local troops? Alas, there is the doubtful point. We think forty
         thousand rifles and a hundred guns, but, if my scheme comes off, not a
         tenth of them should be South of <span class="location">Achi Baba</span> for the first two days. Hints
         have been thrown out that we are asking the French cat to pull the
         hottest chestnut out of the fire. Not at all. At<span class="location"> Kum Kale</span>, with their
         own ships at their back, and the deep <span class="location">Mendere River</span> to their front,
         <span class="person">d'Amade's</span> men should easily be able to hold their own for a day or
         two,--all that we ask of them.</p>
      
      
      <p>The backbone of my enterprise is the <span class="unit">29th Division</span>. At dawn I intend to
         land the covering force of that Division at <span class="location">Sedd-el-Bahr</span>, <span class="location">Cape Helles</span>
         and, D.V., in <span class="location">Morto Bay</span>. I tack my D.V. on to <span class="location">Morto Bay</span> because the
         transports will there be under fire from Asia unless the French succeed
         in silencing the guns about Troy or in diverting their aim. Whether then
         our transports can stick it or not is uncertain, like everything else in
         war, only more so. They must if they can and if they can they must; that
         is all that can be said at present.</p>
      
      
      <p>As to the effort to be made to envelop the enemy's right flank along the
         coast between <span class="location">Helles</span> and <span class="location">Krithia</span>, I have not yet quite fixed on the
         exact spot, but I am personally bent upon having it done as even a small
         force so landed should threaten the line of retreat and tend to shake
         the confidence of any Turks resisting us at the Southernmost point.
         Some think these cliffs along that North-west coast unclimbable, but<span class="person"> I
            </span>am sure our fellows will manage to scramble up, and I think their losses
         should be less in doing so than in making the more easy seeming lodgment
         at <span class="location">Sedd-el-Bahr</span> or Helles. The more broken and precipitous the glacis,
         the more the ground leading up to the objective is dead. The guns of the
         Fleet can clear the crest of the cliffs and the strip of sand at their
         foot should then be as healthy as Brighton. If the Turks down at Helles
         are nervous, even a handful landing behind their first line (stretching
         from the old Castle Northwards to the coast) should make them begin to
         look over their shoulders.</p>
      
      
      <p>As to the A. and N.Z. landing, that will be of the nature of a strong
         feint, which may, and we hope will, develop into the real thing. My
         General Staff have marked out on the maps a good circular holding
         position, starting from Fisherman's Hut in the North round along the
         Upper Spurs of the high ridges and following them down to where they
         reach the sea, a little way above <span class="location">Gaba Tepe</span>. If only Birdwood can seize
         this line and fix himself there for a bit, he should in due course be
         able to push on forward to Kojah Dere whence he will be able to choke
         the Turks on the Southern part of <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> with a closer grip and a
         more deadly than we could ever hope to exercise from far away <span class="location">Bulair</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>We are bound to suffer serious loss from concealed guns, both on the sea
         and also during the first part of our landing before we can win ground
         for our guns. That is part of the hardness of the nut. The landings at
         <span class="location">Gaba Tepe</span> and to the South will between them take up all our small craft
         and launches. So I am unable to throw <span class="unit">the Naval Division</span> into action at
         the first go off. They will man the transports that sail to make a show
         at <span class="location">Bulair</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>This is the substance of my opening remarks at the meeting: discussion
         followed, and, at the end, the Navy signified full approval. Neither <span class="person">de
            Robeck</span>, <span class="person">Wemyss</span> nor <span class="person">Roger Keyes</span> are men to buy pigs in pokes; they wanted
         to know all about it and to be quite sure they could play their part in
         the programme. Their agreement is all the more precious. They (the
         Admirals and the Commodore) are also, I fancy, happier in their minds
         now that they know for sure what we soldiers are after. Rumours had been
         busy in the Fleet that we were shaping our course for <span class="location">Bulair</span>. Had that
         been the basis of my plan, we should have come to loggerheads, I think.
         As it is, the sailors seem eager to meet us in every possible way. So
         now we've got to get our orders out.</p>
      
      
      <p>On maps and charts the scheme may look neat and simple. On land and
         water, the trouble will begin and only by the closest thought and
         prevision will we find ourselves in a position to cope with it. To throw
         so many men ashore in so short a time in the teeth of so rapid a current
         on to a few cramped beaches; to take the chances of finding drinking
         water and of a smooth sea; these elemental hazards alone would suffice
         to give a man grey hairs were we practising a manoeuvre exercise on
         the peaceful Essex coast. So much thought; so much  band-o-bast ; so
         much dove-tailing and welding together of naval and military methods,
         signals, technical words, etc., and the worst punishment should any link
         in the composite chain give way. And then--taking success for
         granted--on the top of all this--comes the Turk; "unspeakable" he used
         to be, "unknowable" now. But we shall give him a startler too. If only
         our plans come off the Turk won't have time to turn; much less to bring
         into play all the clever moves foreseen for him by some whose stomachs
         for the fight have been satisfied by their appreciation of its dangers.</p>
      
      
      <p>Units of the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> have been coming along in their transports
         all day. The bay is alive with ships.</p>
      
      
      <p> 11th April, 1915. <span class="location">S.S. "Arcadian</span>"  One of those exquisite days when
         the sunlight penetrates to the heart. <span class="person">Admiral Guepratte</span>, commanding the
         French Fleet, called at 9.45 and in due course I returned his visit,
         when I was electrified to find at his cabin door no common sentry but a
         Beefeater armed with a large battleaxe, dating from about the period of
         Charlemagne. The Admiral lives quite in the old style and is a
         delightful personage; very gay and very eager for a chance to measure
         himself against the enemy. <span class="person">Guepratte</span>, though he knows nothing
         officially, believes that his Government are holding up their sleeve a
         second French Division ear-marked Gallipoli! But why bottle up trumps;
         trumps worth a King's ransome, or a Kaiser's? He gives twice who gives
         quickly (in peace); he gives tenfold who gives quickly (in war). The
         devil of it is the French dare not cable home to ask questions, and as
         for myself, I have not been much encouraged--so far!</p>
      
      
      <p>During the afternoon Admirals <span class="person">de Robeck</span> and <span class="person">Wemyss</span> came on board to work
         together with the General Staff on technical details. They too have
         heard these rumours about the second French Division, and Wemyss is in
         dismay at the thought of having to squeeze more ships into <span class="location">Mudros
            harbour</span>. His anxiety has given me exactly the excuse I wanted, so I have
         dropped this fly just in front of <span class="person">K.</span>'s nose, telling him that "There are
         persistent rumours here amongst the French that <span class="person">General d'Amade</span>'s
         Command is to be joined by another French Division. Just in case there
         is truth in the report you should know that <span class="location">Mudros harbour</span> is as full as
         it will hold until our dash for <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> has been made." We will
         see what he says. If the Division exists, then the Naval people will
         recommend Bizerta for their base; the ships can sail right up to the
         Peninsula from there and land right away until things on <span class="location">Lemnos</span> and
         <span class="location">Tenedos</span> have shaken themselves down.</p>
      
      
      <p>Our first Taube: it passed over the harbour at a great height. One of
         our lumbering seaplanes went up after it like an owl in sunlight, but
         could rise no higher than the masts of the Fleet.</p>
      
      
      <p> 12th April, 1915. <span class="location">S.S. "Arcadian"</span> <span class="location">Lemnos</span>.  The  Queen Elizabeth  has
         been having some trouble with her engines and in the battle of the 18th
         was only able to use one of her propellers. Now she has been overhauled
         and the Admiral has asked me to come on board for her steam trials.
         These are to take place along the coastline of <span class="location">the Peninsula</span> and I have
         got leave to bring with me a party selected from Divisions and Brigades.
         So when I went aboard this morning at 8.30 there were about thirty-five
         Officers present. Starting at once, we steamed at great pace half way up
         the <span class="location">Gulf of Saros</span> and about 1 o'clock turned to go back, slowing down
         and closing in to let me take a second good look at the coast. Our
         studies were enlivened by an amusing incident. Nearing <span class="location">Cape Helles</span>, the
         Queen Elizabeth  went astern, so as to test her reverse turbines. The
         enemy, who must have been watching us like a mouse does a cat, had the
         ill-luck to select just this moment to salute us with a couple of
         shells. As they had been allowing for our speed they were ludicrously
         out of it, the shot striking the water half a mile ahead. We then lay
         off <span class="location">Cape Helles</span> whilst a very careful survey of the whole of that
         section was being made. The Turks, disgusted by their own bad aim, did
         not fire again. On our way back we passed three fakes, old liners
         painted up, funnelled and armed with dummy guns to take off the  Tiger ,
         the  Inflexible  and the  Indomitable . Riding at anchor there, they had
         quite the man-o'-war air and if they draw the teeth of enemy submarines
         (their torpedoes), as they are meant to do, the artists should be given
         decorations. At 6 p.m. dropped anchor and I transhipped myself to the
         <span class="location"> Arcadian </span>. Birdwood and Hunter-Weston had turned up during the day; the
         latter dined and is now more sanguine than myself. He has been getting
         to know his new command better and he says that he did not appreciate
         the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> when he wrote his appreciation!</p>
      
      
      <p> 13th April, <span class="location">1915. S.S. "Arcadian"</span>  Heavy squalls of rain and wind last
         night.  Band-o-bast  badly upset; boats also bottoms upwards and at
         dawn--here in harbour--we found ourselves clean cut off from the shore.
         What a ticklish affair the great landing is going to be! How much at the
         mercy of the winds and waves! Aeolus and Neptune have hardly lost power
         since Greeks and Trojans made history out yonder!</p>
      
      
      <p>Have sent <span class="person">K.</span> an electrical pick-me-up saying that the height of the
         Queen Elizabeth  fire control station had enabled me to see the lie of
         the land better than on my previous reconnaissance, and that, given good
         luck, we hope to get ashore without too great a loss.</p>
      
      
      <p>In the afternoon the wind moderated and I spent an hour or two watching
         practice landings by Senegalese. Our delay is loss, but yet not clear
         loss; that's a sure thing. These niggy-wigs were as awkward as
         golly-wogs in the boats. Every extra hour's practice will save some
         lives by teaching them how to make short work of the ugliest bit of
         their job.</p>
      
      
      <p> 14th April, 1915. <span class="location">S.S. "Arcadian,"</span> <span class="location">Lemnos</span>.  A day so exquisitely lovely
         that it should be chronicled in deathless verse. But we gaze at the
         glassy sea and turn to the deep blue cloudless sky, victory our only
         thought.</p>
      
      
      <p>Colonel Dick, King's Messenger, has arrived bringing letters up to 3rd
         instant. Or rather, he was supposed to have brought them, and it was
         hoped the abundance of his intelligence would have borne some relation
         to the cost of his journey,--about L80 it has been reckoned. As a matter
         of fact, apart from some rubbish, he brings  one  letter for me; none
         for any of the others. Not even a file of newspapers; not even a
         newspaper! In India many, many years ago, we used to call Dick  Burra
         dik hai , Hindustani for,  it is a great worry . So he is only playing
         up to his sobriquet. The little ewe lamb is an epistle from Fitz giving
         me a lively sketch of the rumpus at the War Office when its pontiffs
         grasped for the first time the true bearing of their own orders. There
         was a rush to saddle poor us with the delay as soon as the Cabinet began
         to show impatience. They seem to have expected the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> to
         arrive at top speed in a united squadron to rush straightway ashore.
         They don't yet quite realise, I daresay, that not one of their lovely
         ships has yet put in an appearance. That the men who packed the
         transports and fixed their time tables should say we are too slow is
         hardly playing the game.</p>
      
      
      <p>Never lose your hair: that is a good soldier's motto. My cable of last
         night, wherein I tried to calm their minds by telling them the sea was
         rough and that, even if every one had been here with gaiter buttons
         complete, I must have waited for a change in the weather, has answered
         Fitz's letter by anticipation.</p>
      
      
      <p>Worked all day in my office like a nigger and by mid-day had got almost
         as black as my simile! We are coaling and life has grown dark and noisy.
         In the middle of it, Ashmead-Bartlett came aboard to see me. He has his
         quarters on the  Queen Elizabeth  as one of the Admiralty authorised
         Press Correspondents, or rather, as the only authorised correspondent.
         In Manchuria he was known and his writing was well liked. When he had
         gone, <span class="person">de Robeck</span> and I put through a good lot of business very smoothly.
         A little later on, Captain Ivanoff, commanding H.I.M.S.  <span class="location">Askold</span> , (a
         Russian cruiser well-known to fame in Manchurian days), did me the
         honour to call.</p>
      
      
      <p>After lunch went ashore and saw parties of Australians at embarking and
         disembarking drill. Colonel Paterson, the very man who bear-led me on
         tour during my Australian inspection, was keeping an eye on the "Boys."
         The work of the Australians and Senegalese gave us a good object lesson
         of the relative brain capacities of the two races. Next I went and
         inspected the Armoured Car Section of the <span class="unit">Royal Naval Division</span> under
         Lieutenant-Commander Wedgwood. He is a mighty queer chap. Took active
         part in the South African War. Afterwards became a pacifist M.P.; here
         he is again with war paint and tomahawk. Give me a Pacifist in peace and
         a Jingo in war. Too often it is the other way about.</p>
      
      
      <p>All this took me on to 5.30 p.m. and when I came back on board,
         Hunter-Weston was here. He has been out since last night on <span class="location">H.M.S.
            Dartmouth </span> to inspect the various landing places. His whole tone about
         the Expedition has been transformed. Now he has become the most sanguine
         of us all. He has great hopes that we shall have <span class="location">Achi Baba</span> in our hands
         by sunset on the day of landing. If so he thinks we need have no fear
         for the future.</p>
      
      
      <p>All is worked out now and I do not quite see how we could improve upon
         our scheme with the means at our disposal. If these "means" included a
         larger number of boats and steam launches, then certainly, by
         strengthening our forces on either flank, viz., at <span class="location">Morto Bay</span> (where we
         are sending only one Battalion) and at a landing under the cliffs a mile
         West of <span class="location">Krithia</span> (where we are sending one Battalion), we should greatly
         better our chances. Also, a battery of field guns attached to the Morto
         Bay column, and a couple of mountain guns added to the <span class="location">Krithia</span> column
         would add to our prospects of making a real big scoop. But we cannot
         spare the sea transport except by too much weakening and delaying the
         landing at the point of <span class="location">the Peninsula</span>; nor dare I leave myself without
         any reserve under my own hand. I am inclined, all the same, to squeeze
         one Marine Battalion out of the <span class="unit">Naval Division</span> to strengthen our threat
         to <span class="location">Krithia</span>. Hunter-Weston will be in executive command of everything
         South of <span class="location">Achi Baba</span>; Birdwood of everything to the North.</p>
      
      
      <p>I went very closely with Hunter-Weston into the question of a day or
         night attack. My own leanings are in favour of the first boat-loads
         getting ashore before break of dawn, but Hunter-Weston is clear and
         strong for daylight. There is a very strong current running round the
         point; the exact lie of the beaches is unknown and he thinks the
         confusion inseparable from any landing will be so aggravated by
         attempting it in the dark that he had rather face the losses the men in
         boats must suffer from aimed fire. Executively he is responsible and he
         is backed by his naval associates.</p>
      
      
      <p>Birdwood, on the other hand, is of one mind with me and is going to get
         his first boat-loads ashore before it is light enough to aim. He has no
         current to trouble him, it is true, but he is not landing on any
         surveyed beach and the opposition he will meet with is even more unknown
         than in the case of Helles and <span class="location">Sedd-el-Bahr</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>When a sportsman goes shark fishing, he should beware lest he be
         mistaken for the bait. Gaily I cast my fly over <span class="person">K.</span> and now he has
         snapped off my head. That story about a second French Division was
         false. <span class="person">K.</span> merely quotes the number of my question and adds, "The rumour
         is baseless." Well, " tant pis ," as Guepratte would say with a shrug of
         his shoulders. Our first step won't have the weight behind it we had
         permitted ourselves for some hours to hope.  Everywhere  the first is
         the step that counts but  nowhere  more so than in an Oriental War.</p>
      
      
      <p>Now that the French Division has been snuffed out, how about the Grand
         Duke Nicholas, General Istomine and their Russian Divisions? Are they
         also to prove phantoms? Certainly, in some form or another, they ought
         to be brought into our scheme and, even if only at a distance, bring
         some pressure to bear upon the Turks at the time of our opening move.<span class="person"> I
            </span>think my best way of getting into touch will be by wireless from de
         Robeck to the Russian Admiral in the Black Sea.</p>
      
      
      <p>Dick dines, also Birdwood.</p>
      
      
      <p> 15th April, 1915. <span class="location">S.S. "Arcadian"</span> <span class="location">Lemnos</span>.  Boarded <span class="location">H.M.S.  Dublin </span>
         (Captain Kelly) at 9.30 this morning, where <span class="person">Admiral de Robeck</span> met me.
         Sailed at once and dropped anchor off <span class="location">Tenedos</span> at noon.</p>
      
      
      <p>Landed and made a close inspection of the Aerodrome where we were taken
         round by two young friends of mine, <span class="person">Commander Samson</span> and <span class="person">Captain Davies</span>,
         Naval Air Service. By a queer fluke these are the very two men with whom<span class="person">
            I </span>did my very first flight! On that never to be forgotten day Samson
         took up <span class="person">Winston</span> and <span class="person">Davies</span> took me. Like mallards we shot over the
         Medway and saw the battleships as if they were little children's
         playthings far away down below us. Now the children are going to use
         their pretty toys and will make a nice noise with them in the world.</p>
      
      
      <p>After lunch spent the best part of two hours in a small cottage with
         Samson and <span class="person">Keyes</span> trying to digest the honey brought back by our busy
         aeroplane bees from their various flights over Gallipoli. The Admiral
         went off on some other naval quest.</p>
      
      
      <p>Samson and Davies are fliers of the first water--and not only in the
         air. They carry the whole technique of their job at their finger tips.
         The result of <span class="person">K.</span>'s washing his hands of the Air is that the Admiralty
         run that element entirely. Samson is Boss. He has brought with him two
         Maurice Farmans and three B.E.2s. The Maurice Farmans with 100 H.P.
         Renaults; the B.E.2s with 70 Renaults. These five machines are good
         although one of the B.E.2s is dead old.</p>
      
      
      <p>Also, he brought eight Henri Farmans with 80 Gnome engines. He took them
         because they were new and there was nothing else new; but they are no
         use for war.</p>
      
      
      <p>Two B.E.2C.s with 70 Renaults: these are absolutely useless as they
         won't take a passenger.</p>
      
      
      <p>One Broguet 200 H.P. Canton engine; won't fly.</p>
      
      
      <p>Two Sopwith Scouts: 80 Gnome engines; very old and can't be used owing
         to weakness of engine mounting.</p>
      
      
      <p>One very old but still useful Maurice Farman with 140 Canton engine.
         That is the demnition total and it pans out at five serviceable
         aeroplanes for the Army. There are also some seaplanes with us but they
         are not under Samson, and are purely for naval purposes. Amongst those
         are two good "Shorts," but the others are no use, they say, being wrong
         type and underpowered.</p>
      
      
      <p>The total nominal strength of Samson's Corps is eleven pilots and one
         hundred and twenty men. As everyone knows, no Corps or Service is ever
         up to its nominal strength; least of all an Air Corps. The dangerous
         shortage is that in two-seater aeroplanes as we want our Air Service now
         for spotting and reconnaissances. If,  after  that requirement had been
         met, we had only a bombing force at our disposal, the Gallipoli
         Peninsula, being a very limited space with only one road and two or
         three harbours on it, could probably be made untenable.</p>
      
      
      <p>Commander Samson's estimate of a minimum force for this "stunt," as he
         calls our great enterprise, is 30 good two-seater machines; 24 fighters;
         40 pilots and 400 men. So equipped he reckons he could take the
         Peninsula by himself and save us all a vast lot of trouble.</p>
      
      
      <p>But, strange as it may seem, flying is not my "stunt." I dare not even
         mention the word "aeroplane" to <span class="person">K.</span>, and I have cut myself off from
         correspondence with <span class="person">Winston</span>. I did this thing deliberately as
         <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> reminds me every time I am tempted to sit down and unbosom
         myself to one who would sympathise and lend us a hand if he could: in
         truth, I am torn in two about this; but I still feel it is wiser and
         better so; not only from the <span class="person">K.</span> point of view but also from <span class="person">de Robeck</span>'s.
         He (<span class="person">de Robeck</span>) might be quite glad I should write once to <span class="person">Winston</span> on one
         subject but he would never be sure afterwards I was not writing on
         others. On the way back I spoke to the Admiral, but I don't know whether
         he will write himself or not. Ventured also a little bit out of my own
         element in another direction, and begged him not to put off sending the
         submarine through the Straits until the day of our landing, but to let
         her go directly she was ready. He does not agree. He has an idea (I hope
         a premonition) that the submarine will catch Enver hurrying down to the
         scene of action if we wait till the day of the attack.</p>
      
      
      <p>Even more than in the Fleet I find in the Air Service the profound
         conviction that, if they could only get into direct touch with <span class="person">Winston Churchill</span>
         , all would be well. Their faith in the <span class="person">First Lord</span> is, in every
         sense,  touching . But they can't get the contact and they are
         thoroughly imbued with the idea that the Sea Lords are at the best
         half-hearted; at the worst, actively antagonistic to us and to the whole
         of our enterprise. The photographs, etc., I have studied make it only
         too clear that the Turks have not let the grass grow under their feet
         since the first bombardment; <span class="location">the Peninsula</span>, in fact, is better defended
         than it was.  Per contra  the momentum, precision, swiftness and staying
         power of our actual attack will be at least twice as great now as it
         would have been at the end of March.</p>
      
      
      <p>Returned to <span class="location">Lemnos</span> about 7.30 p.m.</p>
      
      
      <p>While we were away my Staff got aboard the destroyer <span class="location"> Colne </span> and steamed
         in her to the mouth of the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>. There the whole precious load of
         red tabs transshipped to <span class="location">H.M.S.  Triumph </span> (Captain Fitzmaurice), who
         forthwith took up her station opposite <span class="location">Morto Bay</span> and began firing salvos
         with her 6-inch guns at the trenches on the face of the hill. At first
         the Staff watched the show with much enjoyment from the bridge, but
         when howitzers from the Asiatic side began to lob shell over the ship,
         the Captain hustled them all into the conning tower. The Turks seem to
         have shot pretty straight. The first three fell fifty yards short of the
         ship; the fourth shell about twenty yards over her. The next three got
         home. One cut plumb through the bridge (where all my brains had been
         playing about two minutes previously) and burst on the deck just outside
         the conning tower. Some cordite cartridges were lying outside of it and
         these went off with a great flare. Another struck the funnel and the
         third came in on the waterline. Fifteen more shells were then fired with
         just a little bit too much elevation and passed over. Only two men were
         wounded,--fractured legs. Captain Fitzmaurice now decided that honour
         and dignity were satisfied and so fell back slowly towards <span class="location">Cape Helles</span>
         to try the effect of his guns on the barbed wire entanglements. A good
         deal of ammunition was expended but only one hit on the entanglement was
         registered, and that did not seem to do any harm. The fire was described
         to me as inaccurate. The fact is, as was agreed between the two services
         at <span class="location">Malta</span>, the whole principle of naval gunnery is different from the
         principles of garrison or field artillery shooting. Before they will be
         much good at landmarks, the sailors will have to take lessons in the
         art.</p>
      
      
      <p>Passed a very interesting evening, every one excited, I with my
         aeroplane reports; the Staff with the powder they had smelt.</p>
      
      
      <p>Two of the Australian Commanding Officers dined and I showed them the
         aerial photographs of the enemy trenches, etc. The face of one of them
         grew very long; so long, in fact, that I feared he was afraid; for I own
         these photos are frightening. So I said, "You don't seem to like the
         look of that barbed wire, Colonel?" To which he replied, "I was worrying
         how and where I would feed and water the prisoners."</p>
      
      
      <p> 16th April, 1915. <span class="location">S.S. "Arcadian"</span> <span class="location">Lemnos</span>.  Spent the forenoon in
         interviews beginning at 10 a.m. with <span class="person">de Robeck</span> and Mr. Fitzmaurice, late
         dragoman at the Embassy at <span class="location">Constantinople</span>. Mr. Fitzmaurice says the
         Turks will put up a great fight at the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>. They had believed in
         the British Navy, and, a month ago, they were shaking in their shoes.
         But they had not believed in the British Army or that a body so
         infinitely small would be so saucy as to attack them on their own chosen
         ground. Even now, he says, they can hardly credit their spies, or their
         eyes, and it ought to be easy enough to make them think all this is a
         blind, and that we are really going to <span class="location">Smyrna</span> or Adramiti. They are fond
         of saying, "If the English are fools enough to enter our mouth we only
         have to close it." Enver especially brags he will make very short work
         with us if we set foot so near to the heart of his Empire, and gives it
         out that the whole of us will be marching through the streets of
         <span class="location">Constantinople</span>, not as conquerors, but as prisoners, within a week from
         the date of our making the attempt. All the same, despite this bragging,
         the Turks realise that if we were to get the Fleet through the Narrows;
         or, if it were to force its own way through whilst we absorb the
         attention of their mobile guns, the game would be up. So they are
         straining every nerve to be ready for anything. The moral of all these
         rather contradictory remarks is just what I have said time and again
         since South Africa. The fact that war has become a highly scientific
         business should not blind us to the other fact that its roots still draw
         their nutriment from primitive feelings and methods; the feelings and
         methods of boy scouts and Red Indians. It is a huge handicap to us here
         that our great men keep all their tricks for their political friends and
         have none to spare for their natural enemies. There has been very little
         attempt to disguise our aims in <span class="location">England</span>, and <span class="person">Maxwell</span> and <span class="person">McMahon</span> in
         <span class="location">Egypt</span> have allowed their Press to report every arrival of French and
         British troops, and to announce openly that we are about to attack at
         Gallipoli. I have protested and reported the matter to <span class="person">K.</span> but nothing in
         the strategic sphere can be done now although, in the tactical sphere,
         we have several deceptions ready for them.</p>
      
      
      <p>Colonel Napier, Military Attache at Sofia, and <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> came in after
         these pseudo-secrets had been discussed and joined in the conversation.<span class="person">
            I </span>doubt whether either Fitzmaurice or Napier have solid information as
         to what is in front of us, and their yarns about Balkan politics are
         neither here nor there. John Bull is quite out of his depth in the
         defiles of the Balkans. With just so much pull over the bulk of my
         compatriots as has been given me by my having spent a little time with
         their Armies, I may say that the Balkan nations loathe and mistrust one
         another to so great a degree that it is sheer waste of time to think of
         roping them all in on our side, as Fitzmaurice and Napier seem to
         propose. We may get Greece to join us, and Russia may get <span class="location">Roumania</span> to
         join her-- if we win here --but then we make an enemy of <span class="location">Bulgaria</span>, and
         vice versa . If they will unearth my 1909 report at the War Office they
         will see that, at that time, one Bulgarian Battalion of Infantry was
         worth two Battalions of Roumanian Infantry--which may be a help to them
         in making their choice. The Balkan problem is so intricate that it must
         be simply handled. The simple thing is to pay your money and pick the
         best card, knowing you can't have a full hand. So let us have no more
         beating about the bush and may we be inspired to make use of the big
         boom this Expedition has given to Great Britain in the Balkans to pick
         out a partner straightway.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Birdie</span> came later and we took stock together of ways and means. We see
         eye to eye now on every point. Just before lunch we heard the transport
         Manitou  had been attacked by a Turkish torpedo boat from <span class="location">Smyrna</span>. The
         first wireless came in saying the enemy had made a bad shot and only a
         few men had been drowned lowering the boats. <span class="person">Admiral Rosy Wemyss</span> and
         Hope, the Flag-Captain, of the <span class="location">Q.E.</span> were my guests and naturally they
         were greatly perturbed. Late in the evening we heard that the Turkish
         T.B. had been chased by our destroyers and had run ashore on a Greek
         Island where she was destroyed (international laws notwithstanding) by
         our landing parties.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 7.30 p.m. <span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span> came along and I had the best part of an hour
         with him.</p>
      
      
      <p> 17th April, 1915. <span class="location">S.S. "Arcadian"</span> <span class="location">Lemnos</span>.  Hunter-Weston came over
         early to finish off business left undone last night. Admiral Wemyss also
         took part in our discussions over the landing. Picture puzzles are
         child's play compared with this game of working an unheard of number of
         craft to and fro, in and out, of little bits of beaches. At mid-day the
         Manitou  steamed into harbour and Colonel Peel, Commander of the
         troops, came on board and reported fully to me about the attack by the
         Turkish torpedo boat. The Turks seem to have behaved quite decently
         giving our men time to get into their boats and steaming some distance
         off whilst they did so. During the interval the Turks must have got wind
         of British warships, for they rushed back in a great hurry and fired
         torpedoes at so short a range that they passed under the ship. Very
         exciting, we were told, watching them dart beneath the keel through the
         crystal clear water. I can well believe it.</p>
      
      
      <p>Went ashore in the afternoon to watch the Australian Artillery embark.
         Spoke to a lot of the men, some of whom had met me during my tour
         through Australia last year.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">General Paris</span> came to see me this evening.</p>
      
      
      <p> 18th April, 1915. <span class="location">S.S. "Arcadian</span>" <span class="location">Lemnos</span>.  Working all morning in
         office. In the afternoon inspected embarkation of some howitzers.
         <span class="person">D'Amade</span> turned up later from the  Southland . We went over the landing
         at<span class="location"> Kum Kale</span>. He is in full sympathy and understands. Winter, <span class="person">Woodward</span>
         and their administrative Staffs also arrived in the  Southland  and have
         taken up their quarters on this ship. They report everything fixed up at
         <span class="location">Alexandria</span> before they sailed. We are all together now and their coming
         will be a great relief to the General Staff.</p>
      
      
      <p>Quite hot to-day. Sea dead smooth. The usual ebb and flow of visitors.
         Saw the three Corps Commanders and many Staff Officers. We are rather on
         wires now that the time is drawing near; <span class="person">Woodward</span>, though he has only
         been here one night, is on barbed wires. His cabin is next the
         signallers and he could not get to sleep. He wants some medical
         detachments sent up post haste from <span class="location">Alexandria</span>. I have agreed to cable
         for them and now he is more calm. A big pow-wow on <span class="location">the "Q.E."</span> (<span class="person">d'Amade</span>,
         <span class="person">Birdie</span>, <span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span>, <span class="person">Godley</span>, <span class="person">Bridges</span>, <span class="person">Guepratte</span>, Thursby, <span class="person">Wemyss</span>,
         Phillimore, <span class="person">Vyvian</span>, Dent, Loring), whereat the 23rd was fixed for our
         attack and the naval landing orders were read and fully threshed out.<span class="person"> I
            </span>did not attend as the meeting was rather for the purpose of going point
         by point into orders already approved in principle than of starting any
         fresh hares. Staff Officers who have only had to do with land operations
         would be surprised, I am sure, at the amount of original thinking and
         improvisation demanded by a landing operation. The Naval and Military
         Beach Personnel is in itself a very big and intricate business which
         has no place in ordinary soldier tactics. The diagrams of the ships and
         transports; the lists of tows; the action of the Destroyers; tugs;
         lighters; signal arrangements for combined operations: these are
         unfamiliar subjects and need very careful fitting in. <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> came
         back and reported all serene; everyone keen and cooperating very
         loyally. <span class="person">D'Amade</span> has now received the formal letter I wrote him
         yesterday after my interview and sees his way clear about<span class="location"> Kum Kale</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Went ashore in the afternoon and saw big landing by Australians, who
         took mules and donkeys with them and got them in and out of lighters.
         These Australians are shaping into Marines in double quick time and
         Cairo high jinks are wild oats sown and buried. Where everyone wants to
         do well and to do it in the same way, discipline goes down as slick as
         Mother's milk. Action is a discipline in itself.</p>
      
      
      <p>The three Officers forming the French Mission to my Headquarters made
         salaams, viz., Captain Bertier de Sauvigny, Lieutenant Pelliot and
         Lieutenant de la Borde. The first is a man of the world, with manners
         suave and distinguished; the second is a savant and knows the habits of
         obscure and out of the way people. What de la Borde's points may be, I
         English.</p>
      
      
      <p> 20th April, 1915. <span class="location">S.S. "Arcadian"</span> <span class="location">Lemnos</span>.  A big wind rose in the
         night.</p>
      
      
      <p>A clerk from my central office at the Horse Guards developed small pox
         this morning. No doubt he has been in some rotten hole in <span class="location">Alexandria</span> and
         this is the result,--a disgusting one to all of us as we have had to be
         vaccinated.</p>
      
      
      <p>Ready now, but so long as the wind blows, we have to twiddle our thumbs.</p>
      
      
      <p>Got the full text of <span class="person">d'Amades'</span> orders for his<span class="location"> Kum Kale</span> landing as well
         as for the <span class="location">Besika Bay</span> make-believe.</p>
      
      
      <p> 21st April, 1915. <span class="location">S.S. "Arcadian"</span> <span class="location">Lemnos</span>.  Blowing big guns. The event
         with which old mother time is in labour is so big that her pains are
         prodigious and prolonged out of all nature. So near are we now to our
         opening that the storm means a twenty four hours' delay.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have issued my orders to the troops. Yesterday our plans were but plans.
         To-day the irrevocable steps out on to the stage.</p>
      
      
      <p>                                                General Headquarters,
         21st April, 1915. </p>
      
      
      <p>     Soldiers of France and of the King. </p>
      
      
      <p>Before us lies an adventure unprecedented in modern war. Together with
         our comrades of the Fleet, we are about to force a landing upon an open
         beach in face of positions which have been vaunted by our enemies as
         impregnable.</p>
      
      
      <p>The landing will be made good, by the help of God and the Navy; the
         positions will be stormed, and the War brought one step nearer to a
         glorious close.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Remember," said <span class="person">Lord Kitchener</span> when bidding adieu to your Commander,
         "Remember, once you set foot upon <span class="location">the Gallipoli Peninsula</span>, you must
         fight the thing through to a finish."</p>
      
      
      <p>The whole world will be watching your progress. Let us prove our selves
         worthy of the great feat of arms entrusted to us.
         IAN HAMILTON,  General .</p>
      
      
      <p> 22nd April, 1915. <span class="location">S.S. "Arcadian</span>." <span class="location">Lemnos</span>.  Wind worse than ever, but
         weather brighter. Another twenty four hours' delay. Russian Military
         Attache from Athens (Makalinsky) came to see me at 2.30 p.m. He cannot
         give me much idea of how the minds of the Athenians are working. He says
         our Russian troops are of the very best. Delay is the worst
         nerve-cracker.</p>
      
      
      <p>Charley Burn, King's Messenger, came; with him a Captain Coddan, to be
         liaison between me and Istomine's Russians.</p>
      
      
      <p>The King sends his blessing.</p>
      
      
      <p>                       SPECIAL ORDER,</p>
      
      
      <p>                                  General Headquarters,
         22nd April, 1915. </p>
      
      
      <p>The following gracious message has been received to-day by the General
         Commanding:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"The King wishes you and your Army every success, and you are
         constantly in His Majesty's thoughts and prayers."</p>
      
      
      <p> 23rd April, 1915. <span class="location">S.S. "Arcadian"</span> <span class="location">Lemnos</span>.  A gorgeous day at last;
         fitting frame to the most brilliant and yet touching of pageants.</p>
      
      
      <p>All afternoon transports were very, very slowly coming out of harbour
         winding their way in and out through the other painted ships lying thick
         on the wonderful blue of the bay. The troops wild with enthusiasm and
         tremendously cheering especially as they passed the warships of our
         Allies.</p>
      
      
      <p> Nunc Dimittis , O Lord of Hosts! Not a man but knows he is making for
         the jaws of death. They know, these men do, they are being asked to
         prove their enemies to have lied when they swore a landing on
         Gallipoli's shore could never make good. They know that lie must pass
         for truth until they have become targets to guns, machine guns and
         rifles--huddled together in boats, helpless, plain to the enemy's sight.
         And they are wild with joy; uplifted! Life spins superbly through their
         veins at the very moment they seek to sacrifice it for a cause. O death,
         where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?</p>
      
      
      <p>A shadow has been cast over the wonders of the day by a wireless to say
         that Rupert Brooke is very dangerously ill--from the wording we fear
         there can be no hope.</p>
      
      
      <p>Dent, principal Naval Transport Officer, left to-day to get ready.
         <span class="person">Wemyss</span> said good-bye on going to take up command of his Squadron.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have got <span class="person">d'Amade's</span> revised orders for the landing at<span class="location"> Kum Kale</span> and also
         for the feint at <span class="location">Besika Bay</span>. Very clear and good.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 7.15 p.m. we got this message from <span class="person">K.</span>:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"Please communicate the following messages at a propitious moment to
         each of those concerned.</p>
      
      
      <p>"(1) My best wishes to you and all your force in carrying to a
         successful conclusion the operations you have before you, which will
         undoubtedly have a momentous effect on the war. The task they have to
         perform will need all the grit Britishers have never failed to show, and<span class="person">
            I </span>am confident your troops will victoriously clear the way for the Fleet
         to advance on <span class="location">Constantinople</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>"(2) Convey to <span class="person">the Admiral</span> my best wishes that all success may attend
         the Fleet. The Army knows they can rely on their energy and effective
         co-operation while dealing with the land forces of the enemy.</p>
      
      
      <p>"(3) Assure <span class="person">General d'Amade</span> and the French troops of our entire

      <p>CHAPTER V THE LANDING</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 24th April, 1915. <span class="location"> H.M.S. "Queen Elizabeth." </span> <span class="location"> Tenedos.   </span> Boarded the Queen
         Lizzie at 1.30 p.m. Anchored off <span class="location"> Tenedos </span> just before 4 p.m. Lay outside
         the roadstead; close by us is the British Fleet with an Armada of
         transports,--all at anchor. As we were closing up to them we spotted a
         floating mine which must have been passed touch-and-go during the night
         by all those warships and troopships. A good omen surely that not one of
         them fell foul of the death that lurks in that ugly, horned devil--not
         dead itself, but very much alive, for it answered a shot from one of our
         three pounders with the dull roar and spitting of fire and smoke bred
         for our benefit by the kindly German Kultur.</p>
      
      
      <p>I hope I may sleep to-night. I think so. If not, my wakefulness will
         wish the clock's hand forward.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 25th April, 1915.  <span class="location"> H.M.S. "Queen Elizabeth." </span>  Our  Queen  chose the cold
         grey hour of 4 a.m. to make her war toilette. By 4.15 she had sunk the
         lady and put on the man of war. Gone were the gay companions; closed the
         tight compartments and stowed away under armour were all her furbelows
         and frills. In plain English, our mighty battleship was cleared for
         action, and--my mind--that also has now been cleared of its everyday
         lumber: and I am ready.</p>
      
      
      <p>If this is a queer start for me, so it is also for <span class="person"> de Robeck </span> In sea
         warfare, the Fleet lies in the grip of its Admiral like a platoon in the
         hands of a Subaltern. The  Admiral sees; speaks the executive word and
         the whole Fleet moves; not, as with us, each Commander carrying out the
         order in his own way, but each Captain steaming, firing, retiring to the
         letter of the signal. In the Navy the man at the gun, the man at the
         helm, the man sending up shells in the hoist has no discretion unless
         indeed the gear goes wrong, and he has to use his wits to put it right
         again. With us the infantry scout, a boy in his teens perhaps, may have
         to decide whether to open fire, to lie low or to fall back; whether to
         bring on a battle or avoid it. But the Fleet to-day is working like an
         army; the ships are widely scattered each one on its own, except in so
         far as wireless may serve, and that is why I say <span class="person"> de Robeck </span> is working
         under conditions just as unusual to him as mine are to me.</p>
      
      
      <p>My station is up in the conning tower with <span class="person"> de Robeck </span>. The conning tower
         is a circular metal chamber, like a big cooking pot. Here we are, all
         eyes, like potatoes in the cooking pot aforesaid, trying to peep through
         a slit where the lid is raised a few inches,  ad hoc , as these blasted
         politicians like to say. My Staff are not with me in this holy of
         holies, but are stowed away in steel towers or jammed into 6-inch
         batteries.</p>
      
      
      <p>So we kept moving along and at 4.30 a.m. were off <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span>. All
         quiet and grey. Thence we steamed for <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span> and midway, about 5
         o'clock, heard a very heavy fire from <span class="location"> Helles </span> behind us. The Turks are
         putting up some fight. Now we are off <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe! </span></p>
      
      
      <p>The day was just breaking over the jagged hills; the sea was glassy
         smooth; the landing of the lads from the South was in full swing; the
         shrapnel was bursting over the water; the patter of musketry came
         creeping out to sea; we are in for it now; the machine guns muttered as
         through chattering teeth--up to our necks in it now. But would we be out
         of it? No; not one of us; not for five hundred years stuffed full of
         dullness and routine.</p>
      
      
      <p>By 5.35 the rattle of small arms quieted down; we heard that about 4,000
         fighting men had been landed; we could see boat-loads making for the
         land; swarms trying to straighten themselves out along the shore; other
         groups digging and hacking down the brushwood. Even with our glasses
         they did not look much bigger than ants. God, one would think, cannot
         see them at all or He would put a stop to this sort of panorama
         altogether. And yet, it would be a pity if He missed it; for these
         fellows have been worth the making. They are not charging up into this
         <span class="location">Sari Bair </span> range for money or by compulsion. They fight for love--all the
         way from the Southern Cross for love of the old country and of liberty.
         Wave after wave of the little ants press up and disappear. We lose sight
         of them the moment they lie down. Bravo! every man on our great ship
         longs to be with them. But the main battle called. The Admiral was keen
         to take me when and where the need might most arise. So we turned South
         and steamed slowly back along the coast to <span class="location"> Cape Helles. </span></p>
      
      
      <p>Opposite <span class="location"> Krithia </span> came another great moment. We have made good the
         landing--sure--it is a fact. I have to repeat the word to myself several
         times, "fact," "fact," "fact," so as to be sure I am awake and standing
         here looking at live men through a long telescope. The thing seems
         unreal; as though I were in a dream, instead of on a battleship. To see
         words working themselves out upon the ground; to watch thoughts move
         over the ground as fighting men....!</p>
      
      
      <p>Both Battalions, <span class="unit"> the Plymouth </span> and the <span class="unit"> K.O.S.B.s, </span> had climbed the high
         cliff without loss; so it was signalled; there is no firing; the Turks
         have made themselves scarce; nothing to show danger or stress; only
         parties of our men struggling up the sandy precipice by zigzags,
         carrying munitions and large glittering kerosine tins of water. Through
         the telescope we can now make out a number of our fellows in groups
         along the crest of the cliff, quite peacefully reposing--probably
         smoking. This promises great results to our arms--not the repose or the
         smoking, for I hope that won't last long--but the enemy's surprise. In
         spite of <span class="location"> Egypt </span> and the  Egyptian Gazette ; in spite of the spy system of
         <span class="location"> Constantinople </span>, we have brought off our tactical  coup  and surprised
         the enemy Chief. The bulk of the Turks are not at <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span>; here, at
         "Y," there are none at all!</p>
      
      
      <p>In a sense, and no mean sense either, I am as much relieved, and as
         sanguine too, at the  coup  we have brought off here as I was just now
         to see <span class="person"> Birdie's </span> four thousand driving the Turks before them into the
         mountains. The schemes are not on the same scale. If the Australians get
         through to Mal Tepe the whole Turkish Army on the Peninsula will be done
         in. If the "Y" Beach lot press their advantage they may cut off the
         enemy troops on the toe of the Peninsula. With any luck, the <span class="unit"> K.O.S.B.s </span>
         and <span class="unit"> Plymouths </span> at "Y" should get right on the line of retreat of the
         Turks who are now fighting to the South.</p>
      
      
      <p>The point at issue as we sailed down to "X" Beach was whether that
         little force at "Y" should not be reinforced by the Naval Division who
         were making a feint against the Bulair Lines and had, by now, probably
         finished their work. <span class="person"> Braithwaite </span> has been speaking to me about it. The
         idea appealed to me very strongly because I have been all along most
         keen on the "Y" Beach plan which is my own special child; and this would
         be to make the most of it and press it for all it was worth. But, until
         the main battle develops more clearly at <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span> and at <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span>
         I must not commit the only troops I have in hand as my Commander-in-Chief's reserve.</p>
      
      
      <p>When we got to "X" Beach the foreshore and cliffs had been made good
         without much loss in the first instance, we were told, though there is a
         hot fight going on just south of it. But fresh troops will soon be
         landing:--so far so good. Further round, at "W" Beach, another lodgment
         had been effected; very desperate and bloody, we are told by the Naval
         Beachmaster: and indeed we can see some of the dead, but the <span class="unit"> Lancashire
            Fusiliers </span> hold the beach though we don't seem yet to have penetrated
         inland. By <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span>, where we hove to about 6.45, the light was very
         baffling; land wrapped in haze, sun full in our eyes. Here we watched as
         best we could over the fight being put up by the Turks against our
         forlorn hope on the <span class="location">  River Clyde . </span> Very soon it became clear that we
         were being held. Through our glasses we could quite clearly watch the
         sea being whipped up all along the beach and about the <span class="location">  River Clyde  </span> by
         a pelting storm of rifle bullets. We could see also how a number of our
         dare-devils were up to their necks in this tormented water trying to
         struggle on to land from the barges linking the <span class="location"> River Clyde </span> to the
         shore. There was a line of men lying flat down under cover of a little
         sandbank in the centre of the beach. They were so held under by fire
         they dared not, evidently, stir. Watching these gallant souls from the
         safety of a battleship gave me a hateful feeling: <span class="person"> Roger Keyes </span> said to me
         he simply could not bear it. Often a Commander may have to watch
         tragedies from a post of safety. That is all right. I have had my share
         of the hair's breadth business and now it becomes the turn of the
         youngsters. But, from the battleship, you are outside the frame of the
         picture. The thing becomes monstrous; too cold-blooded; like looking on
         at gladiators from the dress circle. The moment we became satisfied that
         none of our men had made their way further than a few feet above sea
         level, the <span class="location">  Queen  </span> opened a heavy fire from her 6-inch batteries upon
         the Castle, the village and the high steep ground ringing round the
         beach in a semi-circle. The enemy lay very low somewhere underground. At
         times the <span class="location">  River Clyde  </span> signalled that the worst fire came from the old
         Fort and <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span>; at times that these bullets were pouring out from
         about the second highest rung of seats on the West of that amphitheatre
         in which we were striving to take our places. Ashore the machine guns
         and rifles never ceased--tic tac, tic tac, brrrr--tic tac, tic tac,
         brrrrrr...... Drowned every few seconds by our tremendous salvoes, this
         more nervous noise crept back insistently into our ears in the interval.
         As men fixed in the grip of nightmare, we were powerless--unable to do
         anything but wait.</p>
      
      <div class="Clyde"><img src="images/S.S._River_CLyde_2.png" alt="ya_4_people" width="535" height= "400"/>
         <p style="text-align:center">S.S. River Clyde</p></div>
      
      <p>When we saw our covering party fairly hung up under the fire from the
         Castle and its outworks, it became a question of issuing fresh orders to
         the main body who had not yet been committed to that attack. There was
         no use throwing them ashore to increase the number of targets on the
         beach. <span class="person"> Roger Keyes </span> started the notion that these troops might well be
         diverted to "Y" where they could land unopposed and whence they might be
         able to help their advance guard at "V" more effectively than by direct
         reinforcement if they threatened to cut the Turkish line of retreat from
         <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span>. <span class="person"> Braithwaite </span> was rather dubious from the orthodox General
         Staff point of view as to whether it was sound for G.H.Q. to barge into
         <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston's </span> plans, seeing he was executive Commander of the whole
         of this southern invasion. But to me the idea seemed simple common
         sense. If it did not suit <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston's </span> book, he had only to say so.
         Certainly <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> was in closer touch with all these landings than
         we were; it was not for me to force his hands: there was no question of
         that: so at 9.15 I wirelessed as follows:</p>
      
      
      <p>"G.O.C. in C. to G.O.C. <span class="location">  Euryalus . </span>"</p>
      
      
      <p>"Would you like to get some more men ashore on 'Y' beach? If so,
         trawlers are available."</p>
      
      
      <p>Three quarters of an hour passed; the state of affairs at <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span>
         was no better, and in an attack if you don't get better you get worse;
         the supports were not being landed; no answer had come to hand. So
         repeated my signal to <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span>, making it this time personal from
         me to him and ordering him to acknowledge receipt. (Lord Bobs'
         wrinkle):--</p>
      
      
      <p>" <span class="person"> General Hamilton </span> to <span class="person"> General Hunter-Weston </span>, <span class="location">  Euryalus . </span></p>
      
      
      <p>"Do you want any more men landed at 'Y'? There are trawlers available.
         Acknowledge the signal."</p>
      
      
      <p> At 11 a.m. I got this answer:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"From <span class="person"> General Hunter-Weston </span> to G.O.C. <span class="location">  Queen Elizabeth . </span></p>
      
      
      <p>" <span class="person"> Admiral Wemyss </span> and Principal Naval Transport Officer state that to
         interfere with present arrangements and try to land men at 'Y' Beach
         would delay disembarkation."</p>
      
      
      <p>There was some fuss about the <span class="location">  Cornwallis . </span> She ought to have been back
         from <span class="location"> Morto Bay </span> and lending a hand here, but she had not turned up. All
         sorts of surmises. Now we hear she has landed our right flank attack
         very dashingly and that we have stormed de Tott's Battery! I fear the
         <span class="unit"> South Wales Borderers </span> are hardly strong enough alone to move across and
         threaten <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span> from the North. But the news is fine. How I wish
         we had left "V" Beach severely alone. Big flanking attacks at "Y" and
         "S" might have converged on <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span> and carried it from the rear
         when none of the garrison could have escaped. But then, until we tried,
         we were afraid fire from Asia might defeat the de Tott's Battery attack
         and that the "Y" party might not scale the cliffs. The Turks are
         stronger down here than at <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span>. Still, I should doubt if they are
         in any great force; quite clearly the bulk of them have been led astray
         by our feints, and false rumours. Otherwise, had they even a regiment in
         close reserve, they must have eaten up the <span class="unit"> S.W.B. </span> as they stormed the
         Battery.</p>
      
      
      <p>About noon, a Naval Officer <span class="person"> Lieutenant Smith </span>, a fine fellow, came off
         to get some more small arm ammunition for the machine guns on the <span class="location">  River
            Clyde . </span> He said the state of things on and around that ship was "awful,"
         a word which carried twentyfold weight owing to the fact that it was
         spoken by a youth never very emotional, I am sure, and now on his mettle
         to make his report with indifference and calm. The whole landing place
         at "V" Beach is ringed round with fire. The shots from our naval guns,
         smashing as their impact appears, might as well be confetti for all the
         effect they have upon the Turkish trenches. The <span class="location">  River Clyde  </span> is
         commanded and swept not only by rifles at 100 yards' range, but by
         pom-poms and field guns. Her own double battery of machine guns mounted
         in a sandbag revetment in her bows are to some extent forcing the enemy
         to keep their heads down and preventing them from actually rushing the
         little party of our men who are crouching behind the sand bank. But
         these same men of ours cannot raise head or hand one inch beyond that
         lucky ledge of sand by the water's brink. And the bay at <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span>
         so the last messengers have told us, had turned red. The <span class="location">  River Clyde  </span>
         so far saves the situation. She was only ready two days before we
         plunged.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 1.30 heard that <span class="person"> d'Amade </span> had taken Kum Kale. <span class="person"> De Robeck </span> had already
         heard independently by wireless that the French (the 6th Colonials under
         Nogues) had carried the village by a bayonet charge at 9.35 a.m. On the
         Asiatic side, then, things are going as we had hoped. The Russian
         <span class="location">  Askold  </span> and the <span class="location">  Jeanne d'Arc  </span> are supporting our Allies in their
         attack. Being so hung up at "V," I have told <span class="person"> d'Amade </span> that he will not be
         able to disembark there as arranged, but that he will have to take his
         troops round to "W" and march them across.</p>
      
      
      <p>At two o'clock a large number of our wounded who had taken refuge under
         the base of the arches of the old Fort at <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span> began to signal
         for help. The <span class="location">  Queen Elizabeth  </span> sent away a picket boat which passed
         through the bullet storm and most gallantly brought off the best part of
         them.</p>
      
      
      <p>Soon after 2 o'clock we were cheered by sighting our own brave fellows
         making a push from the direction of "W." We reckon they must be
         <span class="unit"> Worcesters </span> and <span class="unit"> Essex </span> men moving up to support the <span class="unit"> Royal Fusiliers </span> and
         the <span class="unit"> Lancashire Fusiliers </span>, who have been struggling unaided against the
         bulk of the Turkish troops. The new lot came along by rushes from the
         Westwards, across from "X" to "W" towards <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span>, and we prayed
         God very fervently they might be able to press on so as to strike the
         right rear of the enemy troops encircling "V" Beach. At 3.10 the leading
         heroes--we were amazed at their daring--actually stood up in order the
         better to cut through a broad belt of wire entanglement. One by one the
         men passed through and fought their way to within a few yards of a
         redoubt dominating the hill between Beaches "W" and "V." This belt of
         wire ran perpendicularly, not parallel, to the coastline and had
         evidently been fixed up precisely to prevent what we were now about to
         attempt. To watch V.C.s being won by wire cutting; to see the very
         figure and attitude of the hero; to be safe oneself except from the off
         chance of a shell,--was like being stretched upon the rack! All day we
         hung  vis-a-vis  this inferno. With so great loss and with so desperate
         a situation the white flag would have gone up in the South African War
         but there was no idea of it to-day and I don't feel afraid of it even
         now, in the dark of a moonless night, where evil thoughts are given most
         power over the mind.</p>
      
      
      <p>Nor does <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span>. We had a hurried dinner, <span class="person"> de Robeck </span>, <span class="person"> Keyes </span>,
         <span class="person"> Braithwaite </span>, <span class="person"> Godfrey </span>, and I, in the signal office under the bridge.
         As we were finishing <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> came on board. After he had told us
         his story, breathlessly and listened to with breathless interest, I
         asked him what about our troops at "Y"? He thought they were now in
         touch with our troops at "X" but that they had been through some hard
         fighting to get there. His last message had been that they were being
         hard pressed but as he had heard nothing more since then he assumed they
         were all right--! Anyway, he was cheery, stout-hearted, quite a good
         tonic and--on the whole--his news is good.</p>
      
      
      <p>To sum up the doings of the day; the French have dealt a brilliant
         stroke at Kum Kale; we have fixed a grip on the hills to the North of
         <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span>; also, we have broken through the enemy's defences at "X" and
         "W," two out of the three beaches at the South point of the Peninsula.
         The "hold-up" at the third, "V" (or <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span>) causes me the keenest
         anxiety--it would never do if we were forced to re-embark at night as
         has been suggested--we must stick it until our advance from "X" and "W"
         opens that sally port from the sea. There is always in the background of
         my mind dread lest help should reach the enemy  before  we have done
         with <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span>. The enveloping attacks on both enemy flanks have come
         off brilliantly, but have not cut the enemy's line of retreat, or so
         threatened it that they have to make haste to get back. At "S" (Eski
         Hissarlick or <span class="location"> Morto Bay </span>) the 2nd South Wales Borderers have landed in
         very dashing style though under fire from big fortress artillery as well
         as field guns and musketry. On shore they deployed and, helped by
         sailors from the <span class="location">  Cornwallis  </span>, have carried the Turkish trenches in
         front of them at the bayonet's point. They are now dug in on a
         commanding spur but are anxious at finding themselves all alone and say
         they do not feel able, owing to their weakness, to manoeuvre or to
         advance. From "Y," opposite <span class="location"> Krithia </span>, there is no further news. But two
         good battalions at large and on the war path some four or five miles in
         rear of the enemy should do something during the next few hours. I was
         right, so it seems, about getting ashore before the enemy could see to
         shoot out to sea. At <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span>; opposite <span class="location"> Krithia </span> and by Morto Bay we
         landed without too much loss. Where we waited to bombard, as at <span class="location"> Helles </span>
         and <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span>, we have got it in the neck.</p>
      
      
      <p>This "V" Beach business is the blot. <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span> was supposed to be the
         softest landing of the lot, as it was the best harbour and seemed to lie
         specially at the mercy of the big guns of the Fleet. Would that we had
         left it severely alone and had landed a big force at Morto Bay whence we
         could have forced the <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span> Turks to fall back.</p>
      
      
      <p>One thing is sure. Whatever happens to us here we are bound to win
         glory. There are no other soldiers quite of the calibre of our chaps in
         the world; they have  esprit de corps ; they are  volunteers  every one
         of them; they are  for it ; our Officers--our rank and file--have been
         so  entered  to this attack that they will all die--that we will all
         die--sooner than give way before the Turk. The men are not fighting
         blindly as in <span class="location"> South Africa </span>: they are not fighting against forces with
         whose motives they half sympathise. They have been told, and told again,
         exactly what we are after. They understand. Their eyes are wide open:
         they  know  that the war can only be brought to an end by our joining
         hands quickly with the Russians: they  know  that the fate of the Empire
         depends on the courage they display. Should the Fates so decree, the
         whole brave Army may disappear during the night more dreadfully than
         that of Sennacherib; but assuredly they will not surrender: where so
         much is dark, where many are discouraged, in this knowledge I feel both
         light and joy.</p>
      
      
      <p>Here I write--think--have my being. To-morrow night where shall we be?
         Well; what then; what of the worst? At least we shall have lived, acted,
         dared. We are half way through--we shall not look back.</p>
      
      
      <p>As night began to settle down over the land, the <span class="location">  Queen Elizabeth  </span>
         seemed to feel the time had come to give full vent to her wrath. An
         order from the bridge, and, in the twinkling of an eye, she shook from
         stem to stern with the recoil from her own efforts. The great ship was
         fighting all out, all in action. Every gun spouted flame and a roar
         went up fit to shiver the stars of Heaven. Ears stopped with wax; eyes
         half blinded by the scorching yellow blasts; still, in some chance
         seconds interval, we could hear the hive-like b rr rr rr rr rr r r r r
         of the small arms plying on the shore; still see, through some break in
         the acrid smoke, the profile of the castle and houses; nay, of the very
         earth itself and the rocky cliff; see them all, change, break, dissolve
         into dust; crumble as if by enchantment into strange new outlines, under
         the enormous explosions of our 15-in. lyddite shells. Buildings gutted:
         walls and trenches turned inside out and upside down: friend and foe
         surely must be wiped out together under such a fire: at least they are
         stupefied--must cease taking a hand with their puny rifles and machine
         guns? Not so. Amidst falling ruins; under smoke clouds of yellow, black,
         green and white; the beach, the cliffs and the ramparts of the Castle
         began, in the oncoming dusk, to sparkle all over with hundreds of tiny
         flecks of rifle fire.</p>
      
      
      <p>Just before the shadows of night hid everything from sight, we could see
         that many of our men, who had been crouching all day under the sandy
         bank in the centre of the arena, were taking advantage of the pillars of
         smoke raised between them and their enemy to edge away to their right
         and scale the rampart leading to the Fort of <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span>. Other small
         clusters lay still--they have made their last attack.</p>
      
      
      <p>Now try to sleep. What of those men fighting for their lives in the
         darkness. I put them there. Might they not, all of them, be sailing
         back to safe England, but for me? And I sleep! To sleep whilst thousands
         are killing one another close by! Well, why not; I  must  sleep whilst I
         may. The legend whereby a Commander-in-Chief works wonders during a
         battle dies hard. He may still lose the battle in a moment by losing
         heart. He may still help to win the battle by putting a brave face upon
         the game when it seems to be up. By his character, he may still stop the
         rot and inspire his men to advance once more to the assault. The old
         Bible idea of the Commander:--when his hands grew heavy Amalek
         advanced; when he raised them and willed victory Israel prevailed
         over the heathen! As regards directions, modifications, orders,
         counter-orders,--in precise proportion as his preparations and operation
         orders have been thoroughly conceived and carried out, so will the
         actual conflict find him leaving the actual handling of the troops to
         <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span>  as I am bound to do. I <span class="person"> Old Oyama </span> cooled his brain during the
         battle of the Shaho by shooting pigeons sitting on Chinese chimneys.
         King Richard before Bosworth saw ghosts. My own dark hours pass more
         easily as I make my cryptic jottings in pedlar's French. The detachment
         of the writer comes over me; calms down the tumult of the mind and paves
         a path towards the refuge of sleep. No order is to be issued until I get
         reports and requests. I can't think now of anything left undone that I
         ought to have done; I have no more troops to lay my hands
         on-- <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> has more than he can land to-night; I won't mend
         matters much by prowling up and down the gangways. <span class="person"> Braithwaite </span> calls me
         if he must. No word yet about the losses except that they have been
         heavy. If the Turks get hold of a lot of fresh men and throw them upon
         us during the night,--perhaps they may knock us off into the sea. No
         General knows his luck. That's the beauty of the business. But I feel
         sanguine in the spirit of the men; sanguine in my own spirit; sanguine
         in the soundness of my scheme. What with the landing at <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span> and at
         Kum Kale, and the feints at Bulair and <span class="location"> Besika Bay </span>, the Turkish troops
         here will get no help to-night. And our fellows are steadily pouring
         ashore.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 26th April, 1915.  <span class="location"> H.M.S. "Queen Elizabeth. </span>"  At 12.5 a.m. I was dragged
         out of a dead sleep by <span class="person"> Braithwaite </span> who kept shaking me by the shoulder
         and saying, "Sir Ian! Sir Ian!!" I had been having a good time for an
         hour far away somewhere, far from bloody turmoil, and before I quite
         knew where I was, my Chief of Staff repeated what he had, I think, said
         several times already, "Sir Ian, you've got to come right along--a
         question of life and death--you must settle it!" <span class="person"> Braithwaite </span> is a cool
         hand, but his tone made me wide awake in a second. I sprang from bed;
         flung on my "British Warm" and crossed to the Admiral's cabin--not his
         own cabin but the dining saloon--where I found <span class="person"> de Robeck </span> himself,
         Rear-Admiral <span class="person"> Thursby </span> (in charge of the landing of the Australian and New
         Zealand Army Corps), <span class="person"> Roger Keyes </span>, <span class="person"> Braithwaite </span>, Brigadier-General
         <span class="person"> Carruthers </span> (Deputy Adjutant and Quartermaster-General of the Australian
         and New Zealand Army Corps) and Brigadier-General <span class="person"> Cunliffe Owen </span>
         (Commanding Royal Artillery of the Australian and New Zealand Army
         Corps). A cold hand clutched my heart as I scanned their faces.
         Carruthers gave me a message from <span class="person"> Birdwood </span> written in his writing.
         I read it aloud:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"Both my Divisional Generals and Brigadiers have represented to me that
         they fear their men are thoroughly demoralised by shrapnel fire to which
         they have been subjected all day after exhaustion and gallant work in
         morning. Numbers have dribbled back from firing line and cannot be
         collected in this difficult country. Even <span class="unit"> New Zealand Brigade </span> which has
         been only recently engaged lost heavily and is to some extent
         demoralised. If troops are subjected to shell fire again to-morrow
         morning there is likely to be a fiasco as I have no fresh troops with
         which to replace those in firing line. I know my representation is most
         serious but if we are to re-embark it must be at once.
         ( Sd. ) <span class="person"> "BIRDWOOD." </span></p>
      
      
      <p>The faces round that table took on a look--when I close my eyes there
         they sit,--a look like nothing on earth unless it be the guests when
         their host flings salt upon the burning raisins. To gain time I asked
         one or two questions about the tactical position on shore, but
         <span class="person"> Carruthers </span> and Cunliffe Owen seemed unable to add any detail to
         <span class="person"> Birdwood </span>'s general statement.</p>
      
      
      <p>I turned to Thursby and said, "Admiral, what do you think?" He said, "It
         will take the best part of three days to get that crowd off the
         beaches." "And where are the Turks?" I asked. "On the top of 'em!"
         "Well, then," I persisted, "tell me, Admiral, what do  you  think?"
         "What do I think: well, I think myself they will stick it out if only it
         is put to them that they must." Without another word, all keeping
         silence, I wrote <span class="person"> Birdwood </span> as follows:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"Your news is indeed serious. But there is nothing for it but to dig
         yourselves right in and stick it out. It would take at least two days to
         re-embark you as Admiral Thursby will explain to you. Meanwhile, the
         Australian submarine has got up through the Narrows and has torpedoed a
         gunboat at Chunuk. <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> despite his heavy losses will be
         advancing to-morrow which should divert pressure from you. Make a
         personal appeal to your men and Godley's to make a supreme effort to
         hold their ground.
         ( Sd. ) <span class="person"> "IAN HAMILTON </span>."</p>
      
      
      <p>"P.S. You have got through the difficult business, now you have only to
         dig, dig, dig, until you are safe. <span class="person"> Ian H </span>."</p>
      
      
      <p>The men from <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span> made off with this letter; not the men who came
         down here at all, but new men carrying a clear order. Be the upshot what
         it may, I shall never repent that order. Better to die like heroes on
         the enemy's ground than be butchered like sheep on the beaches like the
         runaway Persians at Marathon.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person"> de Robeck </span> and <span class="person"> Keyes </span> were aghast; they pat me on the back; I hope they
         will go on doing so if things go horribly wrong. Midnight decisions take
         it out of one. Turned in and slept for three solid hours like a top till
         I was set spinning once more at 4 a.m.</p>
      
      
      <p>At dawn we were off <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span>. Thank God the idea of retreat had already
         made itself scarce. The old <span class="location">  Queen  </span> let fly her first shot at 5.30 a.m.
         Her shrapnel is a knockout. The explosion of the monstrous shell darkens
         the rising sun; the bullets cover an acre; the enemy seems stunned for a
         while after each discharge. One after the other she took on the Turkish
         guns along Sari Bair and swept the skyline with them.</p>
      
      
      <p>A message of relief and thankfulness came out to us from the shore.
         Seeing how much they loved us--or rather our Long Toms--we hung around
         until about half-past eight smothering the enemy's guns whenever they
         dared show their snouts. By that hour our troops had regained their grip
         of themselves and also of the enemy, and the firing of the Turks was
         growing feeble. An organised counter-attack on the grand scale at dawn
         was the one thing I dreaded, and that has not come off; only a bit of a
         push over the downland by <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span> which was steadied by one of our
         enormous shrapnel. About this time we heard from <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> that
         there was no material change in the situation at <span class="location"> Helles </span> and
         <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span>. I wirelessed, therefore, to d'Amade telling him he would
         not be able to land his men at "V" under <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span> as arranged but
         that he should bring all the rest of the French troops up from <span class="location"> Tenedos </span>
         and disembark them at "W" by <span class="location"> Cape Helles </span>. About this time, also, i.e.,
         somewhere about 9 a.m., we picked up a wireless from the O.C. "Y" Beach
         which caused us some uneasiness. "We are holding the ridge," it said,
         "till the wounded are embarked." Why "till"? So I told the Admiral that
         as <span class="person"> Birdwood </span> seemed fairly comfortable, I thought we ought to lose no
         time getting back to <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span>, taking "Y" Beach on our way. At once
         we steamed South and hove to off "Y" Beach at 9.30 a.m. There the
         <span class="location">  Sapphire  </span>, <span class="location">  Dublin  </span> and <span class="location">  Goliath  </span> were lying close inshore and we could
         see a trickle of our men coming down the steep cliff and parties being
         ferried off to the <span class="location">  Goliath  </span>: the wounded no doubt, but we did not see a
         single soul going  up  the cliff whereas there were many loose groups
         hanging about on the beach. I disliked and mistrusted the looks of these
         aimless dawdlers by the sea. There was no fighting; a rifle shot now and
         then from the crests where we saw our fellows clearly. The little crowd
         and the boats on the beach were right under them and no one paid any
         attention or seemed to be in a hurry. Our naval and military signallers
         were at sixes and sevens. The <span class="location">  Goliath  </span> wouldn't answer; the <span class="location">  Dublin  </span>
         said the force was coming off, and we could not get into touch with the
         soldiers at all. At about a quarter to ten the <span class="location">  Sapphire  </span> asked us to
         fire over the cliffs into the country some hundreds of yards further in,
         and so the <span class="location">  Queen E.  </span> gave <span class="location"> Krithia </span> and the South of it a taste of her
         metal. Not much use as the high crests hid the intervening hinterland
         from view, even from the crow's nests. A couple of shrapnel were also
         fired at the crestline of the cliff about half a mile further North
         where there appeared to be some snipers. But the trickling down the
         cliffs continued. No one liked the look of things ashore. Our chaps can
         hardly be making off in this deliberate way without orders; and yet, if
         they  are  making off "by order," <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> ought to have consulted
         me first as <span class="person"> Birdwood </span> consulted me in the case of the Australians and New
         Zealanders last night. My inclination was to take a hand myself in this
         affair but the Staff are clear against interference when I have no
         knowledge of the facts--and I suppose they are right. To see a part of
         my scheme, from which I had hoped so much, go wrong before my eyes is
         maddening! I imagined it: I pressed it through: a second Battalion was
         added to it and then the <span class="unit"> South Wales Borderers </span>' Company. Many sailors
         and soldiers, good men, had doubts as to whether the boats could get in,
         or whether, having done so, men armed and accoutred would be able to
         scale the yellow cliffs; or whether, having by some miracle climbed,
         they would not be knocked off into the sea with bayonets as they got to
         the top. I admitted every one of these possibilities but said, every
         time, that taken together, they destroyed one another. If the venture
         seemed so desperate even to ourselves, who are desperadoes, then the
         enemy Chief would be of the same opinion only more so; so that,
         supposing we  did  get up, at least we would not find resistance
         organised against us. Whether this was agreed to, or not, cannot say.
         The logic of a C.-in-C. has a convincing way of its own. But in all our
         discussions one thing was taken for granted--no one doubted that once
         our troops had got ashore, scaled the heights and dug themselves in,
         they would be able to hold on: no one doubted that, with the British
         Fleet at their backs, they would at least maintain their bridge-head
         into the enemy's vitals until we could decide what to do with it.</p>
      
      
      <p>At a quarter past ten we steamed, with anxious minds, for <span class="location"> Cape Helles </span>,
         and on the way there, <span class="person"> Braithwaite </span> and I finished off our first cable to
         K.:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"Thanks to God who calmed the seas and to the Royal Navy who rowed our
         fellows ashore as coolly as if at a regatta; thanks also to the
         dauntless spirit shown by all ranks of both Services, we have landed
         29,000 upon six beaches in the face of desperate resistance from strong
         Turkish Infantry forces well backed by Artillery. Enemy are entrenched,
         line upon line, behind wire entanglements spread to catch us wherever we
         might try to concentrate for an advance. Worst danger zone, the open
         sea, now traversed, but on land not yet out of the wood. Our main
         covering detachment held up on water's edge, at foot of amphitheatre of
         low cliffs round the little bay West of <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span>. At sunset last
         night a dashing attack was made by the 29th Division South-west along
         the heights from <span class="location"> Tekke Burnu </span> to set free the Dublins, Munsters and
         Hants, but at the hour of writing they are still pinned down to the
         beach.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The Australians have done wonderfully at <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span>. They got 8,000
         ashore to one beach between 3.30 a.m. and 8.30 a.m.: due to their
         courage; organisation; sea discipline and steady course of boat
         practice. Navy report not one word spoken or movement made by any of
         these thousands of untried troops either during the transit over the
         water in the darkness or nearing the land when the bullets took their
         toll. But, as the keel of the boats touched bottom, each boat-load
         dashed into the water and then into the enemy's fire. At first it seemed
         that nothing could stop them, but by degrees wire, scrub and cliffs;
         thirst, sheer exhaustion broke the back of their impetus. Then the
         enemy's howitzers and field guns had it all their own way, forcing
         attack to yield a lot of ground. Things looked anxious for a bit, but by
         this morning's dawn all are dug in, cool, confident.</p>
      
      
      <p>"But for the number and good shooting of Turkish field guns and
         howitzers, <span class="person"> Birdwood </span> would surely have carried the whole main ridge of
         <span class="location"> Sari Bair </span>. As it is, his troops are holding a long curve upon the crests
         of the lower ridges, identical, to a hundred yards, with the line
         planned by my General Staff in their instructions and pencilled by them
         upon the map.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The French have stormed <span class="location">Kum Kale</span> and are attacking Yeni Shahr. Although
         you excluded Asia from my operations, have been forced by tactical needs
         to ask d'Amade to do this and so relieve us from Artillery fire from the
         Asiatic shore.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Deeply regret to report the death of <span class="person">Brigadier-General Napier</span> and to
         say that our losses, though not yet estimated, are sure to be very
         heavy.</p>
      
      
      <p>"If only this night passes without misadventures, proposed to attack
         <span class="location"> Achi Baba </span> to-morrow with whatever <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> can scrape together of
         the 29th Division. Such an attack should force the enemy to relax their
         grip on <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span>. I can look now to the Australians to keep any
         enemy reinforcements from crossing the waist of the Peninsula."[12]</p>
      
      
      <p>Relief about <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span> is almost swallowed up by the "Y" Beach
         fiasco--as we must, I suppose, take it to be. No word yet from
         <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>At <span class="location"> Helles </span> things are much the same as last night; only, the South Wales
         Borderers are now well dug in on a spur above <span class="location"> Morto Bay </span> and are
         confident.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 1.45 <span class="person"> d'Amade </span> came aboard in a torpedo boat to see me. He has been
         ashore at<span class="location"> Kum Kale </span>and reports violent fighting and, for the time being,
         victory. A very dashing landing, the village stormed; house to house
         struggles; failure to carry the cemetery; last evening defensive
         measures, loopholed walls, barbed wire fastened to corpses; at night
         savage counter attacks led by Germans; their repulse; a wall some
         hundred yards long and several feet high of Turkish corpses; our own
         losses also very heavy and some good Officers among them. All this
         partly from <span class="person"> d'Amade </span> to me; partly his Staff to my Staff. Nogues and his
         brave lads have done their bit indeed for the glory of the Army of
         <span class="location"> France </span>. Meanwhile, <span class="person"> d'Amade </span> is anxious to get his men off soon: he cannot
         well stay where he is unless he carries the village of <span class="location"> Yeni Shahr </span>. <span class="location"> Yeni
            Shahr </span> is perched on the height a mile to the South of him, but it has
         been reinforced from the <span class="location"> Besika Bay </span> direction and to take it would be a
         major operation needing a disembarkation of at least the whole of his
         Division. He is keen to clear out: I agreed, and at 12.5 he went to make
         his preparations.</p>
      
      
      <p>Ten minutes later, when we were on our way back to <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span>, the
         Admiral and <span class="person"> Braithwaite </span> both tackled me, and urged that the French
         should be ordered to hold on for another twenty-four hours--even if for
         no longer. Had they only raised their point before <span class="person"> d'Amade </span> left the
         <span class="location">  Queen Elizabeth  </span>! As it is, to change my mind and my orders would upset
         the French very much and--on the whole--I do not think we have enough to
         go upon to warrant me in doing so. The Admiral has always been keen on
         Kum Kale and I quite understand that Naval aspect of the case. But it is
         all I can do, as far as things have gone, to hang on by my eyelids to
         the Peninsula, and let alone K.'s strong, clear order, I can hardly
         consent, as a soldier, to entangle myself further in Asia, before I have
         made good <span class="location"> Achi Baba </span>. We dare not lose another moment in getting a firm
         footing on the Peninsula and that was why I had signalled d'Amade from
         <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span> to bring up all the rest of his troops from <span class="location"> Tenedos </span> and to
         disembark them at "W" (seeing we were still held up at "V") and why I
         cannot now perceive any other issue. We are not strong enough to attack
         on both sides of the Straits. Given one more Division we might try: as
         things are, my troops won't cover the mileage. On a small scale map, in
         an office, you may make mole-hills of mountains; on the ground there's
         no escaping from its features.</p>
      
      
      <p>As soon as the French Commander took his leave, we steamed back for <span class="location"> Gaba
            Tepe </span>, passing <span class="location"> Cape Helles </span> at 12.20 p.m. Weather now much brighter and
         warmer. Passing "Y" Beach the re-embarkation of troops was still going
         on. All quiet, the <span class="location">  Goliath  </span> says: the enemy was so roughly handled in
         an attack they made last night that they do not trouble our
         withdrawal--too pleased to see us go, it seems! So this part of our plan
         has gone clean off the rails. <span class="person"> Keyes </span> , <span class="person"> Braithwaite </span>, <span class="person"> Aspinall </span>, <span class="person"> Dawnay </span>,
         <span class="person"> Godfrey </span> are sick--but their disappointment is nothing to mine. <span class="person"> De Robeck </span>
         agrees that we don't know enough yet to warrant us in fault-finding or
         intervention. My orders ought to have been taken before a single
         unwounded Officer or man was ferried back aboard ship. Never, since
         modern battles were invented by the Devil, has a Commander-in-Chief been
         so accessible to a message or an appeal from any part of the force. Each
         theatre has its outfit of signallers, wireless, etc., and I can either
         answer within five minutes, or send help, or rush myself upon the scene
         at 25 miles an hour with the <span class="location">  Q.E.'s  </span> fifteen inchers in my pocket. Here
         there is no question of emergency, or enemy pressure, or of haste; so
         much we see plain enough with our own eyes.</p>
      
      
      <p>Whilst having a hurried meal, <span class="person"> Jack Churchill </span> rushed down from the crow's
         nest to say that he thought we had carried the Fort above <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span>.
         He had seen through a powerful naval glass some figures standing erect
         and silhouetted against the sky on the parapet. Only, he argued, British
         soldiers would stand against the skyline during a general action. That
         is so, and we were encouraged to be hopeful.</p>
      
      
      <p>On to <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span> just in time to see the opening, the climax and the end
         of the dreaded Turkish counter attack. The Turks have been fighting us
         off and on all the time, but this is--or rather I can happily now say
         "was"--an organised effort to burst in through our centre. Whether
         burglars or battles are in question, give me sunshine. What had been a
         terror when <span class="person"> Braithwaite </span> woke me out of my sleep at midnight to meet the
         <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span> deputation was but a heightened, tightened sensation thirteen
         hours later.</p>
      
      
      <p>No doubt the panorama was alarming, but we all of us somehow--we on the
         <span class="location">  Q.E.  </span>--felt sure that Australia and New Zealand had pulled themselves
         together and were going to give Enver and his Army a very disagreeable
         surprise.</p>
      
      
      <p>The contrast of the actual with the might-have-been is the secret of our
         confidence. Imagine, had these brave lads entrusted to us by the
         Commonwealth and Dominion now been crowding on the beaches--crowding
         into their boats--whilst some desperate rearguard was trying to hold off
         the onrush of the triumphant Turks. Never would any of us have got over
         so shocking a disaster; now they are about to win their spurs </p>
      
      
      <p>Here come the Turks! First a shower of shells dropping all along the
         lower ridges and out over the surface of the Bay. Very pretty the
         shells--at half a mile! <span class="location"> Prince of Wales's </span> feathers springing suddenly
         out of the blue to a loud hammer stroke; high explosives: or else the
         shrapnel; pure white, twisting a moment and pirouetting as children in
         their nightgowns pirouette, then gliding off the field two or three
         together, an aerial ladies' chain. Next our projectiles, Thursby's from
         the <span class="location">  Queen  </span>, <span class="location">  Triumph  </span>, <span class="location">  Majestic  </span>, <span class="location">  Bacchante  </span>, <span class="location">  London  </span>, and <span class="location">  Prince 
            of Wales  </span>; over the sea they flew; over the heads of our fighters;
         covered the higher hillsides and skyline with smudges of black, yellow
         and green. Smoky fellows these--with a fiery spark at their core, and
         wherever they touch the earth, rocks leap upwards in columns of dust to
         the sky. Under so many savage blows, the labouring mountains brought
         forth Turks. Here and there advancing lines; dots moving over green
         patches; dots following one another across a broad red scar on the flank: 
         others following--and yet others--and others--and others,
         closing in, disappearing, reappearing in close waves converging on the
         central and highest part of our position. The tic tac of the machine
         guns and the rattle of the rifles accompanied the roar of the big guns
         as hail, pouring down on a greenhouse, plays fast and loose amidst the
         peals of God's artillery: we have got some guns right up the precipitous
         cliff: the noise doubled; redoubled; quadrupled, expanded into one
         immense tiger-like growl--a solid mass of the enemy showed itself
         crossing the green patch--and then the good <span class="location">  Queen Lizzie  </span> picked up her
         targets--crash!!! Stop your ears with wax.</p>
      
      
      <p>The fire slackened. The attack had ebbed away; our fellows were holding
         their ground. A few, very few, little dots had run back over that green
         patch--the others had passed down into the world of darkness.</p>
      
      
      <p>A signaller was flag-wagging from a peak about the left centre of our
         line:--"The boys will never forget the <span class="location">  Queen Elizabeth's  </span> help" was
         what he said.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person"> Jack Churchill </span> was right. At 1.50 a wireless came in to say that the
         Irish and Hants from the <span class="location">  River Clyde  </span> had forced their way through
         <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span> village and had driven the enemy clean out of all his
         trenches and castles. Ah, well;  that  load is off our minds: every one
         smiling.</p>
      
      
      <p>Passed on the news to <span class="person"> Birdwood </span>: I doubt the Turks coming on again--but,
         in case, the <span class="unit"> 29th Division's </span> feat of arms will be a tonic.</p>
      
      
      <p>I was wrong. At 3 p.m. the enemy made another effort, this time on the
         left of our line. We shook them badly and were rewarded by seeing a <span class="location"> New
            Zealand </span> charge. Two Battalions racing due North along the coast and
         foothills with levelled bayonets. Then again the tumult died away.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 4.30 we left <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span> and sailed for <span class="location"> Helles </span>. At 4.50 we were
         opposite <span class="location"> Krithia </span> passing "Y" Beach. The whole of the troops, plus
         wounded, plus gear, have vanished. Only the petrol tins they took for
         water right and left of their pathway up the cliff; huge diamonds in the
         evening sun. The enemy let us slip off without shot fired. The last
         boat-load got aboard the <span class="location">  Goliath  </span> at 4 p.m., but they had forgotten
         some of their kit, so the Bluejackets rowed ashore as they might to
         Southsea pier and brought it off for them--and again no shot fired!</p>
      
      
      <p>Hove to off <span class="location"> Cape Helles </span> at quarter past five. Joyous confirmation of
         <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span> capture and our lines run straight across from "X" to Morto
         Bay, but a very sad postscript now to that message: Doughty Wylie has
         been killed leading the sally from the beach.</p>
      
      
      <p>The death of a hero strips victory of her wings. Alas, for Doughty
         Wylie! Alas, for that faithful disciple of Charles Gordon; protector of
         the poor and of the helpless; noblest of those knights ever ready to lay
         down their lives to uphold the fair fame of <span class="location"> England </span>. Braver soldier
         never drew sword. He had no hatred of the enemy. His spirit did not need
         that ugly stimulant. Tenderness and pity filled his heart and yet he had
         the overflowing enthusiasm and contempt of death which alone can give
         troops the volition to attack when they have been crouching so long
         under a pitiless fire. Doughty Wylie was no flash-in-the-pan V.C.
         winner. He was a steadfast hero. Years ago, at <span class="location"> Aleppo </span>, the mingled
         chivalry and daring with which he placed his own body as a shield
         between the Turkish soldiery and their victims during a time of massacre
         made him admired even by the Moslems. Now; as he would have wished to
         die, so has he died.</p>
      
      
      <p>For myself, in the secret mind that lies beneath the conscious, I think
         I had given up hope that the covering detachment at "V" would work out
         their own salvation. My thought was to keep pushing in troops from "W"
         Beach until the enemy had fallen back to save themselves from being cut
         off. <span class="unit"> The Hampshires </span>, <span class="unit"> Dublins </span> and <span class="unit"> Munsters </span> have turned their own tight
         corner, but I hope these fine Regiments will never forget what they owe
         to one Doughty Wylie, the Mr. Greatheart of our war.</p>
      
      
      <p>The Admiral and <span class="person"> Braithwaite </span> have been at me again to urge that the
         French should hang on another day at Kum Kale. They point out that the
         crisis seems over for the time being both at <span class="location"> Helles </span> and <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span> and
         argue that this puts a different aspect on the whole question. That is
         so, and on the whole, <span class="person">I</span> think "yes" and have asked d'Amade to comply.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 6.20 p.m. started back intending to see all snug at <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span>, but,
         picking up some Turkish guns as targets in <span class="location"> Krithia </span> and on the slopes of
         <span class="location"> Achi Baba </span>, we hove to off and opened fire. We soon silenced
         these guns, though others, unseen, kept popping. At 6.50 we ceased fire.
         At 7, <span class="person"> Admiral Guepratte </span> came on board and tells us splendid news about
         Kum Kale. At 2 o'clock the artillery fire from shore and ships became
         too hot for the Turks entrenched in the cemetery and they put up the
         white flag and came in as prisoners, 500 of them. A hundred more had
         been taken during the night fighting, but there was treachery and some
         of those were killed.<span class="location"> Kum Kale </span>has been a brilliant bit of work, though
         I fear we have lost nearly a quarter of our effectives. <span class="person"> Guepratte </span> agrees
         we would do well to hold on for another 24 hours. At a quarter past
         seven he took his leave and we let drop our anchor where we were, off
         Cape Tekke.</p>
      
      
      <p>So now we stand on Turkish  terra firma . The price has been paid for
         the first step and that is the step that counts. Blood, sweat, fire;
         with these we have forged our master key and forced it into the lock of
         the Hellespont, rusty and dusty with centuries of disuse. Grant us, O
         Lord, tenacity to turn it; determination to turn it, till through that
         open door <span class="location">  Queen Elizabeth  </span> of England sails East for the Golden Horn!
         When in far off ages men discuss over vintages ripened in Mars the black
         superstitions and bloody mindedness of the Georgian savages, still they
         will have to drain a glass to the memory of the soldiers and sailormen
         who fought here.</p>

      <p>CHAPTER VI MAKING GOOD</p>
      
      
      
      <p>  27th April, 1915. Getting on for midnight. <span class="location"> H.M.S. "Queen Elizabeth ." </span>
         All sorts of questions and answers. At 2 a.m. got a signal from  Admiral
         <span class="person"> Guepratte </span>, "Situation at<span class="location"> Kum Kale </span>excellent, but <span class="person"> d'Amade </span> gave orders to
         re-embark. It has begun. Much regret it is not in my power to stop it."</p>
      
      
      <p>Well, so do I regret it. With just one more Brigade at our backs we
         would have taken and kept our grip on Kum Kale; helping along
         the Fleet; countering the big guns from Asia. But, there it is; as
         things are I was right, and beggars can't be choosers. The French are
         now free to land direct at <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span>, or "V," instead of round by
         "W."</p>
      
      
      <p>During the small hours I wrote a second cable to tell him
         <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> could not attack <span class="location"> Achi Baba </span> yesterday as his troops were
         worn out and some of his Battalions had lost a quarter of their
         effectives: also that we were already short of ammunition. Also that
         "<span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span> was a dreadful place to carry by open assault, being a
         labyrinth of rocks, galleries, ruins and entanglements." "With all the
         devoted help of the Navy, it has taken us a day's hard fighting to make
         good our footing. <span class="location"> Achi Baba Hill </span>, only a cannon shot distant, will be
         attacked to-morrow, the 28th."</p>
      
      
      <p>After shipping ammunition for her big guns the <span class="location">  Q.E.  </span> sailed at 7 a.m.
         for <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span> where we found <span class="person"> Birdwood </span>'s base, the beach, being very
         severely shelled. The fire seemed to drop from half the points of the
         compass towards that one small strip of sand, so marvellously well
         defiladed by nature that nine-tenths of the shot fell harmlessly into
         the sea. The Turkish gunners had to chance hitting something by lobbing
         shrapnel over the main cliff or one of the two arm-like promontories
         which embraced the little cove,--and usually they didn't! Yet even so
         the beach was hardly a seaside health resort and it was a comfort to see
         squads of these young soldiers marching to and fro and handling packing
         cases with no more sign of emotion than railway porters collecting
         luggage at <span class="location"> Margate. </span></p>
      
      
      <p>At 7.55 we presented the Turks with some remarkable specimens of sea
         shells to recompense them for their trouble in so narrowly searching our
         beaches. They accepted our 6 inchers with a very good grace. Often one
         of our H.E. hundred pounders seemed to burst just where a field gun had
         been spotted:--and before our triumphant smiles had time to disentangle
         themselves from our faces, the beggars would open again. But the 15-inch
         shrapnel, with its 10,000 bullets, was a much more serious projectile.
         The Turks were not taking more than they could help. Several times we
         silenced a whole battery by one of these monsters. No doubt these very
         batteries are now getting back into concealed positions where our
         ships' guns will not be able to find them. Still, even so, to-day and
         to-morrow are the two most ticklish days; after that, let the storm
         come--our troops will have rooted themselves firmly into the soil.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have been speaking to the sailors about getting man-killing H.E. shell
         for the Mediterranean Squadron instead of the present armour piercers
         which break into only two or three pieces and are, therefore, in the
         open field, more alarming than deadly. They don't seem to think there
         would be much good gained by begging for special favours through routine
         channels. Officialdom at the Admiralty is none too keen on our show. If
         we can get at Winston himself, then we can rely on his kicking red tape
         into the waste-paper basket; otherwise we won't be met half way. As for
         me,I am helpless. I cannot write Winston--not on military business;
         least of all on Naval business.  I  am fixed, I won't write to any public
         personage re my wants and troubles excepting only <span class="person"> Braithwaite </span> agrees
         that, especially in war time, no man can serve two masters. There has
         been so much stiletto work about this war, and I have so often blamed
         others for their backstairs politics, that I must chance hurt feelings
         and shall not write letters although several of the Powers that Be have
         told me to keep them fully posted. The worst loss is that of Winston's
         ear; high principles won't obtain high explosives. As to writing to the
         Army Council--apart from K., the War Office is an oubliette.</p>
      
      
      <p>The foregoing sage reflections were jotted down between 10 and 10.30
         a.m., when I was clapped into solitary confinement under armour. An
         aeroplane had reported that the <span class="location">  Goeben  </span> had come into the Narrows,
         presumably to fire over the Peninsula with her big guns. There was no
         use arguing with the sailors; they treat me as if I were a mascot. So I
         was duly shut up out of harm's way and out of their way whilst they made
         ready to take on the ship, which is just as much the cause of our Iliad
         as was Helen that of Homer's. Up went our captive balloon; in ten
         minutes it was ready to spot and at 10.15 we got off the first shot
         which missed the <span class="location">  Goeben  </span> by just a few feet to the right. The enemy
         then quickly took cover behind the high cliffs and I was let out of my
         prison. Some Turkish transports remained, landing troops. Off flew the
         shell, seven miles it flew; over the Turkish Army from one sea into
         another. A miss! Again she let fly. This time from the balloon came down
         that magic formula "O.K." (plumb centre). We danced for joy though
         hardly able really to credit ourselves with so magnificent a shot: but
         it was so: in two minutes came another message saying the transport was
         sinking by the stern! O.K. for us; U.P. with the Turks. Simple letters
         to describe a pretty ghastly affair. Fancy that enormous shell dropping
         suddenly out of the blue on to a ship's deck swarming with troops!</p>
      
      
      <p>A wireless from Wemyss to say that the whole of <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span>'s force
         has advanced two miles on a broad front and that the enemy made no
         resistance.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 6 p.m. a heavy squall came down from the North and the Aegean was no
         place for flyers whether heavier or lighter than air. All the Turkish
         guns we could spot from the ship had been knocked out or silenced, so
         <span class="person"> Birdwood </span> and his men were able to get along with their digging. We cast
         anchor off <span class="location"> Cape Helles </span> at about 6.30 p.m.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 7 <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> came on board and dined. He is full of confidence and
         good cheer.  He never gave any order to evacuate "Y"; he never was
         consulted; he does not know who gave the order.  He does well to be
         proud of his men and of the way they played up to-day when he called
         upon them to press back the enemy. He has had no losses to speak of and
         we are now on a fairly broad three-mile front right across the toe of
         the Peninsula; about two miles from the tip at <span class="location"> Helles </span>. Had our men not
         been so deadly weary, there was no reason we should not have taken Achi
         Baba from the Turks, who put up hardly any fight at all. But we have not
         got our mules or horses ashore yet in any numbers, and the digging, and
         carriage of stores, water and munitions to the firing line had to go on
         all night, so the men are still as tired as they were on the 26th, or
         more so. The Intelligence hear that enemy reinforcements are crossing
         the Narrows. So it is a pity we could not make more ground whilst we
         were about it, but we had no fresh men to put in and the used Battalions
         were simply done to a turn.</p>
      
      
      <p>We did not talk much about the past at dinner, except--ah me, how
         bitterly we regretted our 10 per cent. margin to replace casualties,--a
         margin allowed by regulation and afforded to the B.E.F. Just think of
         it. To-day each Battalion of the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> would have been joined by
         two keen Officers and one hundred keen men--fresh--all of them fresh!
         The fillip given would have been far, far greater than that which the
         mere numbers (1,200 for the Division) would seem to imply. <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span>
         says that he would sooner have a pick-me-up in that form than two fresh
         Battalions, and I think, in saying so, he says too little.</p>
      
      
      <p>Tired or not tired, we attack again to-morrow. We must make more--much
         more--elbow room before the Turks get help from Asia or <span class="location"> Constantinople. </span></p>
      
      
      <p>Are we to strike before or after daylight? <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> is clear for
         day and we have made it so. The hour is to be 8 a.m.</p>
      
      
      <p>Showed <span class="person"> H.W. </span> the cable we got at tea time from K., quoting some message
         <span class="person"> de Robeck </span> has apparently sent home and saying, " <span class="person"> Maxwell </span> will give you
         any support from the garrison of Egypt you may require." I am puzzled
         how to act on this. <span class="person"> Maxwell </span> won't give me "any support" I "may require";
         otherwise, naturally, I'd have had the Gurkhas with me now: he has his
         own show to run: I have my own show to run: it is for <span class="person"> K. </span> to split the
         differences. <span class="person"> K. </span> gave me fair warning before I started I must not embroil
         him with French, <span class="location"> France </span>, or British politicians by squeezing him for
         more troops. It was up to me to take the job on those terms or leave
         it--and I took it on. I did think Egypt might be held to be outside
         this tacit covenant, but when I asked first, directly, for the Indian
         Brigade; secondly, for the Brigade or even for one <span class="unit"> Gurkha Battalion </span>, I
         only got that chilliest of refusals--silence. Since then, there has been
         some change in his attitude. I do wish <span class="person"> K. </span> would take me more into his
         confidence. Never a word to me about the Indian Brigade, yet now it is
         on its way! Also, here comes this offer of more troops. <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span>'s
         reading of the riddle is that troops ear-marked for the Western front
         are still taboo but that <span class="person"> K. </span> finds himself, since our successful landing,
         in a more favourable political atmosphere and is willing, therefore, to
         let us draw on Egypt. He thinks, in a word, that as far as Egypt goes,
         we should try and get what we can get.</p>
      
      
      <p>Said good-night with mutual good wishes, and have worked till now (1
         a.m.) answering wireless and interviewing <span class="person"> Winter </span> and <span class="person"> Woodward </span>, who had
         come across from the <span class="location">  Arcadian  </span> to do urgent administrative work. Each
         seems satisfied with the way his own branch is getting on: <span class="person"> Winter </span> is the
         quicker worker. Wrote out also a second long cable to <span class="person"> K. </span> (the first was
         operations) formally asking leave to call upon <span class="person"> Maxwell </span> to send me the
         <span class="unit"> East Lancs </span>. Division and showing that <span class="person"> Maxwell </span> can have my second Mounted
         Division in exchange.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have thought it fair to cable <span class="person"> Maxwell </span> also, asking him to hold the <span class="unit"> East
            Lancs </span>. handy. <span class="person"> K.'s </span> cable covers me so far. No Commander enjoys parting
         with his troops and <span class="person"> Maxwell </span> may play on one of the tenderest spots in
         <span class="person"> K.'s </span> adamantine heart by telling him his darling <span class="location"> Egypt </span> will be
         endangered; still it is only right to give him fair warning.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person"> Lord Hindlip </span>, King's Messenger, has brought us our mails.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 28th April, 1915.  <span class="location"> H.M.S. "Queen Elizabeth." </span> Off Gallipoli.  At 9 a.m.
         <span class="person"> General d'Amade </span> came aboard and gave me the full account of the Kum Kale
         landing, a brilliant piece of work which will add lustre even to the
         illustrious deeds of <span class="location"> France </span>. I hope the French Government will recognize
         this dashing stroke of <span class="person"> d'Amade </span>'s by something more solid than a thank
         you.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 9.40 General Paris and the Staff of the<span class="unit"> Naval Division</span> also came
         aboard, and were telling me their doings and their plans when the noise
         of the battle cut short the pow-wow. The fire along the three miles
         front is like the rumble of an express train running over fog signals.
         Clearly we are not going to gain ground so cheaply as yesterday.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 10 o'clock the <span class="location">  Q.E.  </span> was steaming slowly Northwards and had reached
         a point close to the old "Y" landing place (well marked out by the
         glittering kerosine tins). Suddenly, inland, a large mass of men,
         perhaps two thousand, were seen doubling down a depression of the ground
         heading towards the coast. We had two 15-inch guns loaded with 10,000
         shrapnel bullets each, but there was an agony as to whether these were
         our fellows falling back or Turks advancing. The Admiral and <span class="person"> Keyes </span> asked
         me. The Flag Captain was with us. The thing hung on a hair but the
         horror of wiping out one of my own Brigades was too much for me: 20 to
         1 they were Turkish reinforcements which had just passed through
         <span class="location"> Krithia </span>--50 to 1 they were Turks--and then--the ground seemed to swallow
         them from view. Ten minutes later, they broke cover half a mile lower
         down the Peninsula and left us no doubt as to what they were, advancing
         as they did in a most determined manner against some of our men who had
         their left flank on the cliffs above the sea.</p>
      
      
      <p>The Turks were no longer in mass but extended in several lines, less
         than a pace between each man. Before this resolute attack our men, who
         were much weaker, began to fall back. One Turkish Company, about a
         hundred strong, was making an ugly push within rifle shot of our ship.
         Its flank rested on the very edge of the cliff, and the men worked
         forward like German Infantry in a regular line, making a rush of about
         fifty yards with sloped arms and lying down and firing. They all had
         their bayonets fixed. Through a glass every move, every signal, could be
         seen. From where we were our guns exactly enfiladed them. Again they
         rose and at a heavy sling trot came on with their rifles at the slope;
         their bayonets glittering and their Officer ten yards ahead of them
         waving his sword. Some one said they were cheering. Crash! and the
         <span class="location">  Q.E.  </span> let fly a shrapnel; range 1,200 yards; a lovely shot; we followed
         it through the air with our eyes. Range and fuse--perfect. The huge
         projectile exploded fifty yards from the right of the Turkish line, and
         vomited its contents of 10,000 bullets clean across the stretch whereon
         the Turkish Company was making its last effort. When the smoke and dust
         cleared away nothing stirred on the whole of that piece of ground. We
         looked for a long time, nothing stirred.</p>
      
      
      <p>One hundred to the right barrel--nothing left for the second barrel! The
         tailor of the fairy tale with his "seven at a blow" is not in it with
         the gunnery Lieutenant of a battleship. Our beloved <span class="location">  Queen  </span> had drawn
         the teeth of the Turkish counter-attack on our extreme left. The enemy
         no longer dared show themselves over the open downs by the sea, but
         worked over broken ground some hundreds of yards inland where we were
         unable to see them. The <span class="location">  Q.E.  </span> hung about here shelling the enemy and
         trying to help our fellows on for the whole day.</p>
      
      
      <p>As was signalled to us from the shore by an Officer of the <span class="unit"> Border
            Regiment </span>, the Turks were in great strength somewhere not easy to spot a
         few hundred yards inland from "Y" Beach. Some were in a redoubt, others
         working down a ravine. A party of our men had actually got into the
         trench dug by the "Y" Beach covering party on the day of the landing,
         but had been knocked out again, a few minutes before the <span class="location">  Queen
            Elizabeth  </span> came to the rescue, and, in falling back, had been (so the
         Officer signaller told us) "badly cut up." Asked again who were being
         badly cut up, he replied, "All of us!" No doubt the <span class="location">  Q.E.  </span> turned up in
         the very nick of time, at a moment when we were being forced to retire
         too rapidly. A certain number of stragglers were slipping quietly back
         towards <span class="location"> Cape Helles </span> along the narrow sandy strip at the foot of the
         high cliffs, so, as it was flat calm, I sent Aspinall off in a small
         boat with orders to rally them. He rowed to the South so as to head them
         off and as the dinghy drew in to the shore we saw one of them strip and
         swim out to sea to meet it half way. By the time the young fellow
         reached the boat the cool salt water had given him back his presence of
         mind and he explained, as if it was the most natural thing in the world,
         that he had swum off to get help for the wounded! After landing, a show
         of force was needed to pull the fugitives up but once they did pull up
         they were splendid, and volunteered to a man to follow Aspinall back
         into the firing line. Many of them were wounded and the worst of these
         were put into a picket boat which had just that moment come along. One
         of the men seemed pretty bad, being hit in the head and in the body. He
         wanted to join in but, naturally, was forbidden to do so. Aspinall then
         led his little party back and climbed the cliff. When he got to the top
         and looked round he found this severely wounded man had not only
         disobeyed orders and followed him, but had found strength to lug up a
         box of ammunition with him. "I ordered you not to come," said Aspinall:
         "I can still pull a trigger, Sir," replied the man.[13]</p>
      
      
      <p>To-day's experiences have been of the strangest. As armies have grown
         and as the range of firearms has increased, the Commander-in-Chief of
         any considerable force has been withdrawn further and further from the
         fighting. To-day I have stood in the main battery which has fired a shot
         establishing, in its way, a record in the annals of destruction.</p>
      
      
      <p>On our left we had gained three miles and had been driven back a mile or
         rather more after doing so, apparently by fresh enemy forces. What would
         have been a promenade if our original covering party had stuck to "Y"
         Beach, had become too difficult for that wearied and greatly weakened
         Brigade. On the British right the <span class="unit"> 88th Brigade </span> pushed back the Turks
         easily enough at first, but afterwards they too came up against stiffer
         resistance from what seemed to be fresh enemy formations until at last,
         i.e., about mid-day, they were held up. The Reserve were then ordered to
         pass through and attack. Small parties are reported to have got into
         <span class="location"> Krithia </span> and one complete Battalion gained a position commanding
         <span class="location"> Krithia </span> --so Wemyss has been credibly informed; but things went wrong;
         they seem to have been  just  too weak.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> is confident as ever and says once his men have dug
         themselves in, even a few inches, they will hold what they have gained
         against any number of Turks.</p>
      
      
      <p>We have been handicapped by the trouble that is bred in the bone of any
         landing on enemy soil. The General wants to strike quick and hard from
         the outset. To do so he must rush his men ashore and by very careful
         plans he may succeed; but even then, unless he can lay hands upon
         wharves, cranes, and all the mechanical appliances to be found in an
         up-to-date harbour, he cannot keep up the supply of ammunition, stores,
         food, water, on a like scale. He cannot do this because, just in
         proportion as he is successful in getting a large number of men on shore
         and in quickly pushing them forward some distance inland, so will it
         become too much for his small craft and his beach frontage to cope with
         the mule transport and carts. Hence, shortage of ammunition and shortage
         of water, which last was the worse felt to-day. But the heavy fighting
         at the landings was what delayed us most.</p>
      
      
      <p>An enemy aeroplane (a Taube) has been dropping bombs on and about the
         <span class="location">  River Clyde . </span></p>
      
      
      <p>There is little of the "joy of the contest" in fighting battles with
         worn-out troops. Even when the men respond by doing wonders, the
         Commander is bound to feel his heart torn in two by their trials, in
         addition to having his brain tortured on anxiety's rack as to the
         result. The number of Officers we have lost is terrible.</p>
      
      
      <p>Seen from the Flagship, the sun set exactly behind the purple island of
         <span class="location">Imbros</span>, and as it disappeared sent out long flame-coloured streamers
         into the sky. The effect was that of a bird of Paradise bringing balm to
         our overwrought nerves.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have published the following order:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"I rely on all Officers and men to stand firm and steadfast to resist
         the attempt of the enemy to drive us back from our present position
         which has been so gallantly won.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The enemy is evidently trying to obtain a local success before
         reinforcements can reach us; but the first portion of these arrive
         to-morrow and will be followed by a fresh Division from Egypt.</p>
      
      
      <p>"It behoves us all, French and British, to stand fast, hold what we have
         gained, wear down the enemy and thus be prepared for a decisive victory.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Our comrades in Flanders have had the same experience of fatigue after
         hard won fights. We shall, I know, emulate their steadfastness and
         achieve a result which will confer added laurels to French and British
         arms." <span class="person"> IAN HAMILTON </span>,"General."</p>
      
      
      <p>Two cables from <span class="person"> K. </span>:--</p>
      
      
      <p>The first repeats a cable he has sent <span class="person"> Maxwell </span>. He begins by saying, "In
         a cable just in from the Dardanelles French Admiral, I see he thinks
         reinforcements are needed for the troops landed on Gallipoli. <span class="person"> Hamilton </span>
         has not made any mention of this to me. All the same yesterday I cabled
         him as follows:--"</p>
      
      
      <p>(Here he quotes the cable already entered in by me yesterday.)</p>
      
      
      <p> <span class="person"> K. </span> goes on, "I hope all your troops are being kept ready to embark, and
         I would suggest you should send the <span class="unit"> Territorial Division </span> if <span class="person"> Hamilton </span>
         wants them. Peyton's transports, etc., etc., etc."</p>
      
      
      <p>The second cable quotes mine of last night wherein I ask leave to call
         for the <span class="unit"> East Lancs </span>. and says, "I feel sure you had better have the
         <span class="unit"> Territorial Division </span>, and I have instructed <span class="person"> Maxwell </span> to embark them. My
         No. 4239 addressed to <span class="person"> Maxwell </span> and repeated to you was sent before
         receiving your telegram under reply. You had better tell him to send off
         the Division to you. I am very glad the troops have done so well. Give
         them a message of hearty congratulations on their successful achievement
         to buck them up."</p>
      
      
      <p>Bravo! but kind as is your message the best buck up for the Army will
         be the news that the lads from <span class="location"> Manchester </span> are on their way to help us.</p>
      
      
      <p>The cable people have pinned a minute to these two messages saying that
         the two hours' pull we have over Greenwich time ought to have let <span class="person"> K. </span> get
         my message  before  he wired to <span class="person"> Maxwell </span>. He may think <span class="person"> Maxwell </span> will take
         it better that way.</p>
      
      
      <p>Before going to bed, I sent him (K.) two cables:--</p>
      
      
      <p>(1) "Last night the Turks attacked the Australians and New Zealanders in
         great force, charging right up to the trenches, bugles blowing and
         shouting 'Allah Hu!' They were bayoneted. The French are landing to lend
         a hand to the <span class="unit">29th Division</span>. <span class="person"> Birdwood's </span> men are very weary and I am
         supporting them with the <span class="unit"> Naval Division </span>." These, I may say, are my very
         last reserves.</p>
      
      
      <p>(2) Telling <span class="person"> K. </span> how "I shall now be able to cheer up my troops by the
         prospect of speedy reinforcements, whilst informing them of your
         congratulations, and appealing to them to continue as they have
         commenced," I go on to say that we have used up the French and the Naval
         Division "so that at present I have no reserve except when he
         arrives and the remainder of the French." I also say, simply, and
         without any reference to the War Office previous denial that there  was 
         any second French Division, " <span class="person"> D'Amade </span> informs me that the other French
         Division is ready to embark if required, so I hope you will urge that it
         be despatched." As to the delay in letting me have the Indian Brigade; a
         delay which has to-day, so say the 29th Division, cost us <span class="location"> Krithia </span> and
         <span class="location"> Achi Baba </span>, I say "Unluckily <span class="person"> Cox </span>'s Brigade is a day late, but I still
         trust it will arrive to-morrow during the day."</p>
      
      
      <p> Bis dot qui cito dat . O truest proverb! One fresh man on <span class="location"> Gallipoli </span>
         to-day was worth five afloat on the Mediterranean or fifty loafing
         around London in the Central Force. At home they are carefully totting
         up figures--I know them--and explaining to the P.M. and the Senior
         Wranglers with some complacency that the sixty thousand effective
         bayonets left me are enough--seeing they are British--to overthrow the
         Turkish Empire. So they would be if I had that number, or anything like
         it, for my line of battle. But what are the facts? Exactly one half of
         my "bayonets" spend the whole night carrying water, ammunition and
         supplies between the beach and the firing line. The other half of my
         "bayonets," those left in the firing line, are up the whole night armed
         mostly with spades digging desperately into the earth. Now and then
         there is a hell of a fight, but that is incidental and a relief. A
         single Division of my old "Central Force," so easily to be spared, so
         wasted where they are, could take this pick and spade work off the
         fighters. But the civilians think, I am certain, we are in France, with
         a service of trains and motor transport at our backs so that our
         "bayonets" are really free to devote their best energies to fighting. My
         troops are becoming thoroughly worn out. And when I think of the three
         huge armies of the Central Force I commanded a few weeks ago in
         England--!</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 29th April, 1915.  <span class="location"> H.M.S. "Q.E." </span> Off the Peninsula.  A biggish sea
         running, subsiding as the day went on--and my mind grew calmer with the
         waves. For we are living hand-to-mouth now in every sense. Two days'
         storm would go very near starving us. Until we work up some weeks'
         reserve of water, food and cartridges, I shan't sleep sound. Have lent
         <span class="person"> Birdwood </span> four Battalions of the <span class="unit"> Royal Naval Division </span> and two more
         Battalions are landing at <span class="location"> Helles </span> to form my own reserve. Two weak
         Battalions; that is the exact measure of my executive power to shape the
         course of events; all the power I have to help either <span class="person"> d'Amade </span> or
         <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Water is a worry; weather is a worry; the shelling from Asia is a thorn
         in my side. The sailors had hoped they would be able to shield the
         Southern point of the Peninsula by interposing their ships but they
         can't. Their gunnery won't run to it--was never meant to run to it--and
         with five going aeroplanes we can't do the spotting. Our Regiments, too,
         will not be their superb selves again--won't be anything like
         themselves--not until they get their terrible losses made good. There is
         no other way but fresh blood for it is sheer human nature to feel flat
         after an effort. Any violent struggle for life always lowers the will to
         fight even of the most cut-and-come-again:--don't I remember well when
         Sir George asked me if the <span class="unit"> Elandslaagte Brigade </span> had it in them to storm
         Pepworth? I had to tell him they were still the same Brigade but not the
         same men. No use smashing in the impregnable sea front if we don't get a
         fresh dose of energy to help us to push into the, as yet, very pregnable
         hinterland. Since yesterday morning, when I saw our men scatter right
         and left before an enemy they would have gone for with a cheer on the
         25th or 26th,--ever since then I have cursed with special bitterness the
         lack of vision which leaves us without that 10 per cent. margin above
         strength which we could, and should, have had with us. The most fatal
         heresy in war, and, with us, the most rank, is the heresy that battles
         can be won without heavy loss--I don't care whether it is in men or in
         ships. The next most fatal heresy is to think that, having won the
         battle, decimated troops can go on defeating fresh enemies without
         getting their 10 per cent. renewed.</p>
      
      <div class="w"><img src="images/W_beach.jpg" alt="ya_4_people" width="535" height= "300"/>
         <p style="text-align:center">"W" BEACH</p></div>
      
      <p>At 9 o'clock I boarded <span class="location"> H.M.S.  Kennett  </span>, a destroyer, and went ashore.
         Commodore <span class="person"> Roger Keyes </span> came along with me, and we set foot on Turkish
         soil for the first time at 9.45 a.m. at "W" Beach. What a scene! An
         ants' nest in revolution. Five hundred of our fighting men are running
         to and fro between cliffs and sea carrying stones wherewith to improve
         our pier. On to this pier, picket boats, launches, dinghies, barges, all
         converge through the heavy swell with shouts and curses, bumps and
         hair's-breadth escapes. Other swarms of half-naked soldiers are
         sweating, hauling, unloading, loading, road-making; dragging mules up
         the cliff, pushing mules down the cliff: hundreds more are bathing, and
         through this pandemonium pass the quiet stretchers bearing pale,
         blood-stained, smiling burdens. First we spent some time speaking to
         groups of Officers and men and hearing what the Beachmasters and
         Engineers had to say; next we saw as many of the wounded as we could and
         then I walked across to the Headquarters of the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> (half a
         mile) to see <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span>. A strange abode for a Boss; some holes
         burrowed into a hillock. In <span class="location"> South Africa </span>, this feature which looks like,
         and actually is, a good observing post, would have been thoroughly
         searched by fire. The Turks seem, so far, to have left it pretty well
         alone.</p>
      
      
      <p>After a long talk during which we fixed up a good many moot points, went
         on to see General <span class="person"> d'Amade </span>. Unluckily he had just left to go on to the
         Flagship to see me. I did not like to visit the French front in his
         absence, so took notes of the Turkish defences on "V" and had a second
         and a more thorough inspection of the beach, transport and storage
         arrangements on "W."</p>
      
      
      <p> <span class="person"> Roper Phillimore </span> (R.N.) and <span class="person"> Fuller </span> stood by and showed me round.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 1.30 p.m. re-embarked on the <span class="location">  Q.E.  </span> and sailed towards <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>After watching our big guns shooting at the enemy's field pieces for
         some time I could stand it no longer--the sight seeing I mean--and
         boarded the destroyer <span class="location">  Colne  </span> which took me towards the beach. Commodore
         <span class="person"> Keyes </span> came along, also <span class="person"> Pollen </span>, <span class="person"> Dawnay </span> and <span class="person"> Jack Churchill </span>. Our destroyer
         got within a hundred yards or so of the shore when we had to tranship
         into a picquet boat owing to the shallow water. Quite a good lot of
         bullets were plopping into the water, so the Commodore ordered the
         <span class="location">  Colne  </span> to lie further out. At this distance from the beach, withdrawn a
         little from the combat, (there was a hottish scrimmage going on), and
         yet so close that friends could be recognised, the picture we saw was
         astonishing. No one has ever seen so strange a spectacle and I very much
         doubt if any one will ever see it again. The Australians and New
         Zealanders had fixed themselves into the crests of a series of high
         sandy cliffs, covered, wherever they were not quite sheer, with box
         scrub. These cliffs were not in the least like what they had seemed to
         be through our glasses when we reconnoitred them at a distance of a mile
         or more from the shore. Still less were they like what I had originally
         imagined them to be from the map. Their features were tumbled, twisted,
         scarred--unclimbable, one would have said, were it not that their faces
         were now pock-marked with caves like large sand-martin holes, wherein
         the men were resting or taking refuge from the sniping. From the
         trenches that ran along the crest a hot fire was being kept up, and
         swarms of bullets sang through the air, far overhead for the most part,
         to drop into the sea that lay around us. Yet all the time there were
         full five hundred men fooling about stark naked on the water's edge or
         swimming, shouting and enjoying themselves as it might be at Margate.
         Not a sign to show that they possess the things called nerves. While we
         were looking, there was an alarm, and long, lean figures darted out of
         the caves on the face of the cliffs and scooted into the firing line,
         stooping low as they ran along the crest. The clatter of the musketry
         was redoubled by the echoing cliffs, and I thought we had dropped in for
         a scrap of some dimensions as we disembarked upon a fragile little
         floating pier and were met by Birdie and Admiral Thursby. A full General
         landing to inspect overseas is entitled to a salute of 17 guns--well, I
         got my dues. But there is no crisis; things are quieter than they have
         been since the landing, Birdie says, and the Turks for the time being
         have been beat. He tells me several men have already been shot whilst
         bathing but there is no use trying to stop it: they take the off chance.
         So together we made our way up a steep spur, and in two hours had
         traversed the first line trenches and taken in the lie of the land. Half
         way we met Generals Bridges and Godley, and had a talk with them, my
         first, with Bridges, since Duntroon days in Australia. From the heights
         we could look down on to the strip of sand running Northwards from Ari
         Burnu towards <span class="location"> Suvla Bay </span>. There were machine guns here which wiped out
         the landing parties whenever they tried to get ashore North of the
         present line. The New Zealanders took these with the bayonet, and we
         held five or six hundred yards more coast line until we were forced back
         by Turkish counter-attacks in the afternoon and evening of the 25th. The
         whole stretch is now dominated by Turkish fire from the ridges, and
         along it lie the bodies of those killed at the first onset, and
         afterwards in the New Zealand bayonet charge. Several boats are stranded
         along this no man's land; so far all attempts to get out at night and
         bury the dead have only led to fresh losses. No one ever landed out of
         these boats--so they say.</p>
      
      
      <p>Towards evening we re-embarked on the <span class="location">  Colne  </span> and at the very moment of
         transhipment from the picquet boat the enemy opened a real hot shrapnel
         fire, plastering with impartiality and liberality our trenches, our
         beaches and the sea. The <span class="location">  Colne  </span> was in strangely troubled water, but,
         although the shot fell all about her, neither she nor the picquet boat
         was touched. Five minutes later we should have caught it properly! The
         Turkish guns are very well hidden now, and the <span class="location">  Q.E.  </span> can do nothing
         against them without the balloon to spot; we can't often spare one of
         our five aeroplanes for <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span>. Going back we had some long range
         shots with the 15-inch guns at batteries in rear of <span class="location"> Achi Baba </span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Anchored off <span class="location"> Cape Helles </span> at dark. A reply in from <span class="person"> Maxwell </span> about the <span class="unit"> East
            Lancs </span>. They are coming!</p>
      
      
      <p>The worst enemy a Chief has to face in war is an alarmist. The Turks are
         indeed stout and terrifying fellows when seen, not in a poetry book but
         in a long line running at you in a heavy jogtrot way with fixed bayonets
         gleaming. But they don't frighten me as much as one or two of my own
         friends. No matter. We are here to stay; in so far as my fixed
         determination can make it so; alive or dead, we stay.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 30th April, 1915. <span class="location"> H.M.S. Queen Elizabeth.  </span> From dawn to breakfast time
         all hands busy slinging shells--modern war sinews--piles of
         them--aboard. The Turks are making hay while the sun shines and are
         letting "V" Beach have it from their 6-inch howitzers on the plains of
         Troy. So, once upon a time, did <span class="location"> Paris </span> shoot forth his arrows over that
         selfsame ground and plug proud Achilles in the heel--and never surely
         was any fabulous tendon more vulnerable than are our Southern beaches
         from Asia. The audacious <span class="person"> Commander Samson </span> cheers us up. He came aboard
         at 9.15 a.m. and stakes his repute as an airman that his fellows will
         duly spot these guns and that once they do so the ships will knock them
         out. I was so pleased to hear him say so that I took him ashore with me
         to "W" Beach, where he was going to fix up a flight over the Asiatic
         shore, as well as select a flat piece of ground near the tip of the
         Peninsula's toe to alight upon.</p>
      
      
      <p>Saw <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span>: he is quite happy. Touched on "Y" Beach; concluded
         least said soonest mended. The issues of the day before yesterday's
         battle seem certainly to have hung on a hair. Apart from "Y" beach
         might-have-beens, it seems that, further inland, detachments of our men
         got into a position dominating <span class="location"> Krithia </span>; a position from which--could
         they have held it--Turkish troops in or South of <span class="location"> Krithia </span> could have been
         cut off from their supplies. These men saw the Turks clear out of
         <span class="location"> Krithia </span> taking machine guns with them. But after half an hour, as we did
         not come on, they began to come back. We were too weak and only one
         Battalion was left of our reserves--otherwise the day was ours. Street,
         the G.S.O.I. of the Division, was in the thick of the battle--too far in
         for his rank, I am told, and he is most emphatic that with one more
         Brigade <span class="location"> Achi Baba </span> would now be in our hands. He said this to me in
         presence of his own Chief and I believe him, although I had rather
         disbelieve. To my mind "a miss is as good as a mile" should run a "miss
         is far worse than a mile." He is a sober-spoken, most gallant Officer.
         But it can't be helped. This is not the first time in history when the
         lack of a ha'porth of tar has spoilt the ship of State. I would bear my
         ills without a groan were it not that from the very moment when I set
         eyes on the Narrows I was sent to prize open, I had set my heart upon
         just this very identical ha'porth of <span class="unit"> tar-- videlicet </span> , the Indian
         Brigade.</p>
      
      
      <p>Our men are now busy digging themselves into the ground they gained on
         the 28th. The Turks have done a good lot of gunnery but no real
         counter-attack. <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span>'s states show that during the past
         twenty-four hours well over half of his total strength are getting
         their artillery ashore, building piers, making roads, or bringing up
         food, water and ammunition into the trenches. This does not take into
         account men locally struck off fighting duty as cooks, orderlies,
         sentries over water, etc., etc. Altogether, it seems that not more than
         one-third of our fast diminishing total are available for actual
         fighting purposes. Had we even a Brigade of those backward <span class="unit"> Territorial
            reserve Battalions </span> with whom the South of England is congested, they
         would be worth I don't know what, for they would release their
         equivalent of first-class fighting men to attend to their own
         business--the fighting.</p>
      
      
      <p>There are quite a little budget of knotty points to settle between
         <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> and <span class="person"> d'Amade </span>, so I made a careful note of them and went
         along to French Headquarters. By bad luck <span class="person"> d'Amade </span> was away, up in the
         front trenches, and I could not well deliver myself to des Coigns. So I
         said I would come again sometime to-morrow and once more wended my way
         along the busy beaches, and in doing so revisited the Turkish defences
         of "V" and "W." The more I look, the more do I marvel at the invincible
         spirit of the British soldier. Nothing is impossible to him; no General
         knows what he can do till he tries. Therefore, he, the British General,
         must always try! must never listen to the rule-of-thumb advisers who
         seek to chain down adventure to precedent. But our wounds make us weaker
         and weaker. Oh that we could fill up the gaps in the thinned ranks of
         those famous Regiments....!</p>
      
      
      <p>Had ten minutes' talk with the French Captain commanding the battery of
         75's now dug in close to the old Fort, where General <span class="person"> d'Amade </span> sleeps, or
         rather, is supposed to sleep. Here is the noisiest spot on God's earth.
         Not only do the 75's blaze away merrily from morn till dewy eve, and
         again from dewy eve till morn, to a tune that turns our gunners green
         with envy, but the enemy are not slow in replying, and although they
         have not yet exactly found the little beggars (most cunningly concealed
         with green boughs and brushwood), yet they go precious near them with
         big shell and small shell, shrapnel and H.E. As I was standing here I
         was greeted by an old Manchurian friend, le capitaine <span class="person"> Reginald Kahn </span>. He
         fought with the Boers against us and has taken his immense bulk into one
         campaign after another. A very clever writer, he has been entrusted by
         the French Government with the compilation of their official history of
         these operations.</p>
      
      
      <p>On my way back to the <span class="location">  Arcadian  </span> (we are leaving the <span class="location">  Queen Elizabeth  </span>
         for a time)--I met a big batch of wounded, knocked out, all of them, in
         the battle of the 28th. I spoke to as many of them as I could, and
         although some were terribly mutilated and disfigured, and although a few
         others were clearly dying, one and all kept a stiff upper lip--one and
         all were, or managed to appear--more than content--happy! This scene
         brought tears into my eyes. The courage of our soldiers goes far beyond
         belief. Were it not so war would be unbearable. How strongly God keeps
         the balance even. In fullest splendour the soul shines out amidst the
         dark shadows of adversity; as a fire goes out when the sunlight strikes
         it, so the burning, essential quality in men is stifled by prosperity
         and success.</p>
      
      
      <p> Later . Our battleships have been bombarding Chunuk--chucking shells
         into it from the Aegean side of the Peninsula--and a huge column of
         smoke is rising up into the evening sky. A proper bonfire on the very
         altar of Mars.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 1st May, 1915. <span class="location"> H.M.S. "Arcadian"  </span> Went ashore first thing. Odd shells
         on the wing. Visited French Headquarters. Again <span class="person"> d'Amade </span> was away. Had a
         long talk with des Coigns, the Chief of Staff, and told him I had just
         heard from <span class="person"> Lord K. </span> that the <span class="unit"> 1st Brigade </span> of the new French Division would
         sail for the Dardanelles on the 3rd inst. Des Coigns is overjoyed but a
         tiny bit hurt, too, that French Headquarters should get the news first
         from me and not from their own War Ministry. He insists on my going
         round the French trenches and sent a capitaine de la Fontaine along with
         me. Until to-day I had quite failed to grasp the extent of the ground we
         had gained. But we want a lot more before we can begin to feel safe. The
         French trenches are not as good as ours by a long chalk, and bullets
         keep coming through the joints of the badly built sandbag revetment. But
         they say, " Un peu de repos, apres, vous verrez, mon general. " During
         my peregrinations I struck the Headquarters of the <span class="unit"> Mediterranean Brigade </span>
         under General Vandenberg, who came round his own men with me. A sturdy,
         thickset fair man with lots of go and very cheery. He is of Dutch
         descent. Later on I came to the Colonial Brigade Headquarters and made
         the acquaintance of <span class="person"> Colonel Ruef </span>, a fine man--every inch a soldier. The
         French have suffered severely but are in fine fighting form. They are
         enchanted to hear about their second Division. For some reason or
         another they have made up their minds that France is not so keen as we
         are to make a present of Constantinople to <span class="location"> Russia </span>. Their intelligence on
         European questions seems much better than ours and they depress me by
         expressing doubts as to whether the Grand Duke <span class="person"> Nicholas </span> has munitions
         enough to make further headway against the Turks in the Caucasus: also,
         as to whether he has even stuff enough to equip Istomine and my rather
         visionary Army Corps.</p>
      
      
      <p>By the time we had passed along the whole of the French second line and
         part of their front line trenches, I  had had about enough. So took leave
         of these valiant Frenchmen and cheery Senegalese and pushed on to the
         advanced observation post of the Artillery where I met General
         <span class="person"> Stockdale </span>, commanding the <span class="unit"> 15th Brigade </span>, <span class="unit"> R.F.A. </span>, and not only saw how the
         land lay but heard some interesting opinions. Also, some ominous
         comments on what armies spend and what Governments scrimp:--that is
         ammunition.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 3 p.m., got back having had a real good sweat. Must have walked at
         least a dozen miles. Soon afterwards <span class="person"> Cox </span>, commanding the <span class="unit"> 29th Indian
            Brigade </span>, came on board to make his salaam. Better late than never is all
         I could say to him: he and his Brigade are sick at not having been on
         the spot to give the staggering Turks a knock-out on the 28th, but he's
         going to lose no more chances; his men are landing now and he hopes to
         get them all ashore in the course of the day.</p>
      
      
      <p>The Intelligence have just translated an order for the 25th April found
         upon the dead body of a Turkish Staff Officer. "Be sure," so it runs,
         "that no matter how many troops the enemy may try to land, or how heavy
         the fire of his artillery, it is absolutely impossible for him to make
         good his footing. Supposing he does succeed in landing at one spot, no
         time should be left him to co-ordinate and concentrate his forces, but
         our own troops must instantly press in to the attack and with the help
         of our reserves in rear he will forthwith be flung back into the sea."</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 2nd May, 1915. <span class="location"> H.M.S. "Arcadian"  </span> Had a sleepless night and strain was
         too great to write or do anything but stand on bridge and listen to the
         firing or go down to the General Staff and see if any messages had come
         to hand.</p>
      
      
      <p>About 10 p.m. I was on the bridge thinking how dark it was and how
         preternaturally still; I felt all alone in the world; nothing stirred;
         even the French 75's had ceased their nerve-racking bark, and then,
         suddenly, in one instant, hell was let loose upon earth. Like a hundred
         peals of thunder the Turkish artillery from both Continents let fly
         their salvoes right, left and centre, and the French and ourselves did
         not lose many seconds in reply. The shells came from Asia and Achi
         Baba:--in a fiery shower, they fell upon the lines of our front
         trenches. Half an hour the bombardment and counter-bombardment, and then
         there arose the deadly crepitation of small arms--no messages--ten times
         I went back and forward to the signal room--no messages--until a new and
         dreadful sound was carried on the night wind out to sea--the sound of
         the shock of whole regiments--the Turkish Allah Din!--our answering loud
         Hurrahs. The moments to me were moments of unrelieved agony. I tried to
         think of some possible source of help I had overlooked and could not. To
         hear the battle cries of the fighting men and be tied to this
         <span class="location">  Arcadian  </span>--what torture!</p>
      
      
      <p>Soon, amidst the dazzling yellow flashes of the bursting shells and star
         bombs, there rose in beautiful parabolas all along our front coloured
         balls of fire, green, red or white; signals to their own artillery from
         the pistols of the Officers of the enemy. An ugly feature, these lights
         so beautiful, because, presumably, in response to their appeal, the
         Turkish shell were falling further down the Peninsula than at first, as
         if they had lengthened their range and fuse, i.e., as if we were falling
         back.</p>
      
      
      <p>By now several disquietening messages had come in, especially from the
         right, and although bad news was better than no news, or seemed so in
         that darkness and confusion, yet my anxious mind was stretched on the
         rack by inability to get contact with the Headquarters of the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> and the French. Bullets or shell had cut some of the wires, and
         the telephone only worked intermittently. At 2 in the morning I had to
         send a battalion of my reserve from the <span class="unit">Royal Naval Division</span> to
         strengthen the French right. At 3 a.m. we heard--not from the
         British--that the British had been broken and were falling back upon the
         beaches. At 4 we heard from <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> that, although the enemy had
         pierced our line at one or two points, they had now been bloodily
         repulsed. Thereupon, I gave the word for a general counter-attack and
         our line began to advance. The whole country-side was covered with
         retreating Turks and, as soon as it was light enough to see, our
         shrapnel mowed them down by the score. We gained quite a lot of ground
         at first, but afterwards came under enfilade fire from machine guns
         cunningly hidden in folds of the ground. There was no forcing of these
         by any  coup de main  especially with worn out troops and guns which had
         to husband their shell, and so we had to fall back on our starting
         point. We have made several hundreds prisoners, and have killed a
         multitude of the enemy.</p>
      
      
      <p>I took <span class="person"> Braithwaite </span> and others of the G.S. with me and went ashore. At
         the pier at "W" were several big lighters filled with wounded who
         were about to be towed out to Hospital ships. Spent the best part
         of an hour on the lighters. The cheeriness of the gallant lads is
         amazing--superhuman!</p>
      
      
      <p>Went on to see <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> at his Headquarters,--a queer Headquarters
         it would seem to our brethren in France! <span class="person"> Braithwaite </span>, Street,
         <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> and <span class="person"> myself </span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Some of our units are shaken, no doubt, by loss of Officers (complete);
         by heavy losses of men (not replaced, or replaceable, under a month) and
         by sheer physical exertion. Small wonder then that one weak spot in our
         barrier gave way before the solid mass of the attacking Turks, who came
         on with the bayonet like true Ghazis. The first part of the rifle fire
         last night was entirely from our own men. The break by one battalion
         gave a grand chance to the only Territorial unit in the <span class="unit">29th Division</span>,
         the <span class="unit"> 5th Royal Scots </span>, who have a first-class commanding Officer and are
         inspired not only by the indomitable spirit of their regular comrades,
         but by the special fighting traditions of Auld Reekie. They formed to a
         flank as if on a peace parade and fell on to the triumphant Turkish
         stormers with the cold steel, completely restoring the fortunes of the
         night. It would have melted a heart of stone, <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> said, to see
         how tired our men looked in the grey of morning when my order came to
         hand urging them to counter-attack and pursue. Not the spirit but the
         flesh failed them. With a fresh Division on the ground nothing would
         have prevented us from making several thousand prisoners; whether they
         would have been able to rush the machine guns and so gain a great
         victory was more problematical. Anyway, our advance at dawn was half
         heroic, half lamentable. The men were so beat that if they tripped and
         fell, they lay like dead things. The enemy were almost in worse plight
         and so we took prisoners, but as soon as we came up against nerveless,
         tireless machine guns we had to stagger back to our trenches.</p>
      
      
      <p>As I write dead quiet reigns on the Peninsula, literally dead quiet. Not
         a shot from gun or rifle and the enemy are out in swarms over the plain!
         but they carry no arms; only stretchers and red crescent flags, for they
         are bearing away their wounded and are burying their piles of dead. It
         is by my order that the Turks are being left a free hand to carry out
         this pious duty.</p>
      
      
      <p>The stretcher-bearers carry their burdens over a carpet of flowers. Life
         is here around us in its most exquisite forms. Those flowers! Poppies,
         cornflowers, lilies, tulips whose colours are those of the rainbow. The
         coast line curving down and far away to meet the extravagant blueness of
         the Aegean where the battleships lie silent--still--smoke rising up
         lazily--and behind them, through the sea haze, dim outlines of <span class="location">Imbros</span>
         and Samothrace.</p>
      
      
      <p>Going back, found that the lighter loads of wounded already taken off
         have by no means cleared the beach. More wounded and yet more. Here,
         too, are a big drove of Turkish prisoners; fine-looking men; well
         clothed; well nourished; more of them coming in every minute and mixing
         up in the strangest and friendliest way with our wounded with whom they
         talk in some dumb-crambo lingo. The Turks are doing yeoman service for
         Germany. If only India were pulling her weight for us on the same scale,
         we should by now be before the gates of Vienna.</p>
      
      
      <p>In the afternoon <span class="person"> d'Amade </span> paid me a long visit. He was at first rather
         chilly and I soon found out it was on account of my having gone round
         his lines during his absence. He is quite right, and I was quite wrong,
         and I told him so frankly which made "all's well" in a moment. My only
         excuse, namely, that I had been invited--nay pressed--to do so by his
         own Chief of Staff, I thought it wiser to keep to myself. Yesterday
         evening he got a cable from his own War Ministry confirming <span class="person"> K.'s </span> cable
         to me about the new French Division; Numbered the <span class="unit"> 156th </span>, it is to be
         commanded by Bailloud, a distinguished General who has held high office
         in Africa--seventy years old, but sharp as a needle. <span class="person"> D'Amade </span> is most
         grateful for the battalion of the <span class="unit">Naval Division</span>; most complimentary
         about the Officers and men and is dying to have another which is,
         evidemment , a real compliment. He promises if I will so to ration
         them on the best of French conserves and wine. The fact is, that the
         proportion of white men in the French Division is low; there are too
         many Senegalese. The battalion from the<span class="unit">Naval Division</span> gives, therefore,
         greater value to the whole force by being placed on the French right
         than by any other use I can put it to although it does seem strange to
         separate a small British unit by the entire French front from its own
         comrades.</p>
      
      
      <p>When <span class="person"> d'Amade </span> had done, <span class="person"> de Robeck </span> came along. No one on the <span class="location">  Q.E.  </span> slept
         much last night: to them, as to us, the dark hours had passed like one
         nightmare after another. Were we miles back from the trenches as in
         France, and frankly dependent on our telephones, the strain would be
         softened by distance. Here we see the flashes; we hear the shots; we
         stand in our main battery and are yet quite cut off from sharing the
         efforts of our comrades. Too near for reflection; too far for
         intervention: on tenter hooks, in fact; a sort of mental crucifixion.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person"> Cox </span> is not going to take his Punjabi Mahommedans into the fighting area
         but will leave them on "W" Beach. He says if we were sweeping on
         victoriously he would take them on but that, as things are, it would not
         be fair to them to do so. That is exactly why I asked <span class="person"> K. </span> for a
         <span class="unit"> Brigade of Gurkhas </span>; not a mixed Brigade.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 3rd May, 1915. <span class="location"> "H.M.T. Arcadian" </span> At 9 p.m. last night there was
         another furious outburst of fire; mainly from the French. 75's and
         rifles vied against one another in making the most infernal  fracas . I
         thought we were in for an  encore  performance, but gradually the uproar
         died away, and by midnight all was quiet. The Turks had made another
         effort against our right, but they could not penetrate the rampart of
         living fire built up against them and none got within charging distance
         of our trenches, so <span class="person"> d'Amade </span> 'phones. He also says that a mass of Turkish
         reserves were suddenly picked up by the French searchlights and the 75's
         were into them like a knife, slicing and slashing the serried ranks to
         pieces before they had time to scatter.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person"> Birdie </span> boarded us at 9 a.m. and told us his troubles. He has
         straightened out his line on the left; after a fierce fight which has
         cost him no less than 700 fresh casualties. But he feels safer now and
         is pretty happy! he is sure he can hold his own against anything except
         thirst. His  band-o-bast  for taking water up to the higher trenches is
         not working well, and the springs he has struck along the beach and in
         the lower gullies are brakish. We are going to try and fix this up for
         him.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 10 o'clock went ashore with <span class="person"> Braithwaite </span> and paid visits to
         <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> and to <span class="person"> d'Amade </span>. We had a conference with each of them,
         Generals and Staff who could be spared from the fighting being present.
         The feeling is hopeful if only we had more men and especially drafts to
         fill up our weakened battalions. The shell question is serious although,
         in this respect, thank Heavens, the French are quite well found. When we
         got back to the ship, heard a Taube had just been over and dropped a
         bomb, which fell exactly between the <span class="location">  Arcadian  </span> and the ammunition ship,
         anchored only about 60 or 70 yards off us!</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 4th May, 1915. <span class="location"> H.M.T. "Arcadian"  </span> Last night again there was all sorts
         of firing and fighting going on, throughout those hours peaceful
         citizens ear-mark for sleep. I had one or two absolutely hair-raising
         messages. Not only were the French troops broken but the 29th Division
         were falling back into the sea. Though frightened to death, I refused to
         part with my reserve and made ready to go and take command of it at
         break of dawn. In the end the French and <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> beat off the
         enemy by themselves. But there is no doubt that some of the French, and
         two Battalions of our own, are badly shaken,--no wonder! Both
         <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> and <span class="person"> d'Amade </span> came on board in the forenoon, <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span>
         quite fixed that  his  men are strained to breaking point and <span class="person"> d'Amade </span>
         emphatic that  his  men will not carry on through another night unless
         they get relief. To me fell the unenviable duty of reconciling two
         contrary persuasions. Much argument as to where the enemy was making his
         main push; as to the numbers of our own rifles (French and English) and
         the yards of trenches each (French and English) have to hold. I decided
         after anxious searching of heart to help the French by taking over some
         portion of their line with the Naval Brigade. There was no help for it.
         <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> agreed in the end with a very good grace.</p>
      
      
      <p>In writing <span class="person"> K. </span> I try to convey the truth in terms which will neither give
         him needless anxiety or undue confidence. The facts have been stated
         very simply, plus one brief general comment. I tell him that the Turks
         would be playing our game by these assaults were it not that in the
         French section they break through the Senegalese and penetrate into the
         position. I add a word of special praise for the<span class="unit">Naval Division</span>, they
         have done so well, but I know there are people in the War Office who
         won't like to hear it. I say, "I hope the new French Division will not
         steam at economic, but full, speed"; and I sum up by the sentence, "The
         times are anxious, but I believe the enemy's cohesion should suffer more
         than ours by these repeated night attacks."</p>

      <p>CHAPTER VII SHELLS
         </p>
      
      
      <p>To-day, the 4th, shells were falling from Asia on both "V" and "W"
         Beaches. We have landed aeroplanes on the Peninsula. The Taube has been
         bothering us again, but wound up its manoeuvres very decently by
         killing some fish for our dinner. Approved an out-spoken cable from my
         Ordnance to the War Office. Heaven knows we have been close-fisted with
         our meagre stocks, but when the Turks are coming right on to the assault
         it is not possible to prevent a spurt of rapid fire from men who feel
         the knife at their throat. "Ammunition is becoming a very serious
         matter, owing to the ceaseless fighting since April 25th. <span class="location"> The  Junia  </span>
         has not turned up and has but a small supply when she does. 18 pr. shell
         is vital necessity."</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 5th May, 1915. <span class="location"> H.M.T. "Arcadian"  </span> A wearing, nerve-racking, night-long
         fire by the Turks and the French 75's. They, at least, both of them,
         seem to have a good supply of shell. To the Jews, God showed Himself
         once as a pillar of fire by night; to the French soldier whose God is
         the 75 He reveals Himself in just the same way, safeguarding his flimsy
         trenches from the impact of the infidel horde. The curse of the method
         is its noise--let alone its cost. But last night it came off: no Turks
         got through anywhere on the French front and the men had not to stand to
         their arms or use their rifles. We British, worse luck, can't dream of
         these orgies of explosives. Our batteries last night did not fire a shot
         and the men had to drive back the enemy by rifle fire. They did it
         easily enough but the process is wearing.</p>
      
      
      <p>An answer has come to my prayer for 18 pr. stuff: not the answer that
         turns away wrath, but the answer that provokes a plaster saint.</p>
      
      
      <p>"We have under consideration your telegram of yesterday. The ammunition
         supply for your force, however, was never calculated on the basis of a
         prolonged occupation of the <span class="location"> Gallipoli </span> Peninsula, we will have to
         reconsider the position if, after the arrival of the reinforcements now
         on their way out to you, the enemy cannot be driven back and, in
         conjunction with the Fleet, the Forts barring the passage of the
         Dardanelles cannot be reduced. It is important to push on."</p>
      
      
      <p>Now <span class="person"> von Donop </span> is a kindly man despite that overbearing "von": yet, he
         speaks to us like this! The survivors of our half dead force are to
         "push on"; for, "it is important to push on" although Whitehall seems to
         have time and to spare to "consider" my cable and to "reconsider the
         position." Death first, diagnosis afterwards. Wherever is the use of
         reconsidering the position now? The position has taken charge. When a
         man has jumped off Westminster Bridge to save a drowning Russian his
         position has got beyond reconsideration: there is only one thing to
         do--as quickly as you can, as much help as you can--and if it comes to a
         choice between the  quick  and the  much : hark to your swimmer and hear
         him cry "Quick! Quick!! Quick!!!"</p>
      
      
      <p>The War Office urge me to throw my brave troops yet once more against
         machine guns in redoubts; to do it on the cheap; to do it without asking
         for the shell that gives the attack a sporting chance. I don't say they
         are wrong in so saying; there may be no other way out of it; but I do
         say the War Office stand convicted of having gone hopelessly wrong in
         their estimates and preparations. For we must have been held up
         somewhere, surely; we must have fought  somewhere . I suppose, even if
         we had forced the Straits--even if we had taken <span class="location"> Constantinople </span> without
         firing a shot, we must have fought somewhere! Otherwise, a child's box
         of tin soldiers sent by post would have been just the thing for the
         Dardanelles landing! No; it's not the advice that riles me: it's the
         fact that people who have made a mistake, and should be sorry, slur over
         my appeal for the stuff advances are made of and yet continue to urge us
         on as if we were hanging back.</p>
      
      
      <p>A strong wind blows and <span class="location"> Helles </span> is smothered in dust. <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> spent
         an hour with me this morning and an hour with the G.S. putting the final
         touches to the plan of attack discussed by us yesterday. The Lancashire
         Brigade of the <span class="unit"> 42nd Division </span> has landed.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Hunter-Bunter </span> stayed to lunch.</p>
      
      
      <p> Later . In the afternoon went ashore and inspected the <span class="unit"> Lancashire
            Brigade </span> of the <span class="unit"> East Lancs </span>. Division just landed; and a very fine lot of
         Officers and men they are. They are keen and ready for to-morrow. Yes,
         to-morrow we attack again: I have men enough now but very, very little
         shell. The Turks have given us three bad nights and they ought to be
         worn out. With our sea power we can shift a couple of Brigades from Gaba
         Tepe to <span class="location"> Helles </span> or vice versa quicker than the Turks can march from the
         one theatre to the other. So the first question has been whether to
         reinforce <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span> from <span class="location"> Helles </span> or vice versa. For reasons too long to
         write here I have decided to attack in the South especially as I had a
         cable from <span class="person">  K. </span> himself yesterday in which he makes the suggestion:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"I hope," he says, "the 5th" (that's to-day) "will see you strong enough
         to press on to <span class="location"> Achi Baba </span> anyway, as delay will allow the Turks to bring
         up more reinforcements and to make unpleasant preparations for your
         reception. The Australians and New Zealanders will have had
         reinforcements from Egypt by then, and, if they hold on to their
         trenches with the help of the<span class="unit">Naval Division</span>, could spare you a good
         many men for the advance."</p>
      
      
      <p>Old <span class="person"> K. </span> is as right as rain here but a little bit after the shower. Had
         he and Maxwell tumbled to the real situation when I first saw with my
         own eyes the lie of the land instead of the lies on their maps; and had
         they let me have the <span class="unit"> Brigade of Gurkhas </span> I asked for by my letters and by
         my cable of 24th March, and by word of mouth and telephone up to the
         last moment of my leaving <span class="location"> Egypt </span>, these homilies about the urgency of
         seizing <span class="location"> Achi Baba </span> would be beside the mark, seeing we should be sitting
         on the top of it.</p>
      
      
      <p>In the matter of giving <span class="person"> K. </span> is built on the model of Pharaoh: nothing
         less than the firstborn of the nation will make him suffer his subjects
         to depart from <span class="location"> Egypt </span>; and Maxwell sees eye to eye with him--that is
         natural. No word of the bombs and trench mortars I asked for six weeks
         ago, but the "bayonets" are coming in liberally now.</p>
      
      
      <p>Two of <span class="person"> Birdwood's </span> Brigades sail down to-night and join up with a Brigade
         from the <span class="unit"> Naval Division </span>, thus making a new composite Division for the
         Southern theatre. <span class="unit"> The 29th </span>, who have lost so very heavily, are being
         strengthened by the new <span class="unit"> Lancashire Fusilier Brigade </span>, and Cox's <span class="unit"> Indian
            Brigade </span>. By no manner the same thing, this, as getting drafts to fill up
         the ranks of the 29th. Always in war there is three times better value
         in filling up an old formation than in making up the total by bringing
         in a new formation. I have given the French the Naval Brigade; the new,
         <span class="unit"> Naval-Australian Division </span> is to form my general reserve.</p>
      
      
      <p>So there! To-morrow morning. We have men enough, and good men too, but
         we are short of pebbles for Goliath of <span class="location"> Achi Baba </span>. These three nights
         have made a big hole in our stocks. Hunter-Weston feels that all is in
         our favour but the artillery. In Flanders, he says, they would never
         attack with empty limbers behind them; they would wait till they were
         full up. But the West is not in its essence a time problem; there, they
         can wait--next week--next month. If we wait one week the Turks will
         have become twice as strong in their numbers, and twice as deep in their
         trenches, as they are to-day. <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> and <span class="person"> d'Amade </span> see that
         perfectly. I hold the idea myself that it would be good tactics, seeing
         shell shortage is our weakness, to make use of the half hour before dawn
         to close with the enemy and then fight it out on their ground. To cross
         the danger zone, in fact, by night and overthrow the enemy in the grey
         dawn. But <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> says that so many regimental officers have been
         lost he fears for the Company leading at night:--for that, most
         searching of military tests, nothing but the best will do.</p>
      
      
      <p>Hard up as we are for shell he thinks it best to blaze it away freely
         before closing and to trust our bayonets when we get in. He and <span class="person">d'Amade</span>
         have both of them their Western experience to guide them. I have agreed,
         subject only to the condition that we must keep some munitions in
         reserve until we hear for certain that more is on its way.</p>
      
      
      <p>The enemy had trusted to their shore defences. There was no second line
         behind them--not this side of <span class="location"> Achi Baba </span>, at least. Now, i.e., ever since
         the failure of their grand attempt on the night of the 2nd-3rd May, they
         have been hard at work. Already their lines cover quite half the ground
         between the Aegean and the Straits; whilst, in rear again, we can see
         wired patches which we guess to be enfilading machine gun redoubts. We
         must resolutely and at all cost make progress and smash up these new
         spiders' webs of steel before they connect into elastic but unbreakable
         patterns.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 9th May, 1915. <span class="location"> H.M.T. "Arcadian" </span> Three days on the rack! Since the
         morning of the 6th not a word have I written barring one or two letters
         and one or two hasty scraps of cables. Now, D.V., there is the best part
         of a day at my disposal and it is worth an effort to put that story
         down.</p>
      
      
      <p>First I had better fix the sequence of the munition cables, for upon
         them the whole attack has hung--or rather, hung fire.</p>
      
      
      <p>On the 6th, the evening of the opening day, we received a postscript to
         the refusal already chronicled:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"Until you can submit a return of the amount you have in hand to enable
         us to work out the rates of expenditure, it is difficult to decide about
         further supplies of ammunition."</p>
      
      
      <p>When I read this I fell on my knees and prayed God to grant me patience.
         Am I to check the number of rounds in the limbers; on the beaches and in
         transit during a battle? Two days after my S.O.S. the War Office begin
         to think about tables of averages!</p>
      
      
      <p>I directed my answer to <span class="person"> Lord K. </span> himself:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"With reference to your No. 4432 of 5th inst., please turn to my letter
         to you of 30th March, wherein I have laid stress on the essential
         difference in the matter of ammunition supply between the Dardanelles
         and <span class="location"> France </span>. In <span class="location"> France </span>, where the factories are within 24 hours' distance
         from the firing line, it may be feasible to consider and reconsider
         situations, including ammunition supply. Here we are distant a
         fortnight. I consider that 4.5 inch, 18 pr. and other ammunition,
         especially Mark VII rifle ammunition, should instantly be despatched
         here  via  Marseilles.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Battle in progress. Advance being held up by stubborn opposition."</p>
      
      
      <p>Within a few hours <span class="person"> K.'s </span> reply came in; he says:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"It is difficult for me to judge the situation unless you can send me
         your expenditure of ammunition for which we have repeatedly asked. The
         question is not affected by the other considerations you mention." If
         space and time have no bearing on strategy and tactics, then <span class="person"> K. </span> is
         right. If ships sail over the sea as fast as railways run across the
         land; if <span class="location"> Helles </span> is nearer Woolwich than Calais; then he is right. I use
         the capital <span class="person"> K. </span> here impersonally, for I am sure the great man did not
         indite the message himself even though it may be headed from him to me.</p>
      
      
      <p>Late that night came another cable from the Master General of the
         Ordnance saying he was sending out "in the next relief ship 10,000
         rounds of 18 pr. shrapnel, and 1,000 rounds of 4.5 inch high explosive."</p>
      
      
      <p>But why the next relief ship? It won't get here for another three weeks
         and by that time we should be, by all the laws of nature and of war, in
         Davy Jones's locker. True, we don't mean to be, whatever the Ordnance
         may do or leave undone but, so far as I can see, that won't be their
         fault. Neither I nor my Staff can make head or tail of these cables.
         They seem so unlike <span class="person"> K. </span>; so unlike all the people. Here we are:--The
         Turks in front of us--too close: the deep sea behind us--too close. We
         beg them "instantly" to send us 4.5 inch and other ammunition;
         "instantly,  via  Marseilles":--they tell us in reply that they will
         send 1,000 rounds of the vital stuff, the 4.5 high explosive, " in the
         next relief ship "!</p>
      
      
      <p>Why, even in the South African War, before the siege of Ladysmith, one
         battery would fire five hundred rounds in a day. And this 1,000 rounds
         in the next relief ship ( via  <span class="location"> Alexandria </span>) will take three weeks to get
         to us whereas stress was laid by me upon the <span class="location"> Marseilles </span> route.</p>
      
      
      <p>Now, to-day, (the 9th), I have at last been able to send the Ordnance a
         statement (made under extreme difficulty) of our ammunition expenditure;
         up to the 5th May; i.e., before the three days' battle began. We were
         then nine million small arm still to the good having spent eleven
         million. We had shot away 23,000 shrapnel, 18 pr., and had 48,000 in
         hand. We had fired off 5,000 of that (most vital) 4.5 howitzer and had
         1,800 remaining. A.P.S. has been added saying the amounts shown had been
         greatly reduced by the last two days' battle. Actually, they have fallen
         to less than half and, as I have said, we had, on the evening of the
         7th, only 17,000 rounds of 18 pr. on hand for the whole Peninsula. Out
         of this we have fought the battle of the 8th and I believe we have run
         down now to under 10,000, some fear as low as 5,000.</p>
      
      
      <p>Very well. Now for my last night's cable which, in the opinion of my
         Officers, summarises general result of lack of shell:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"For the past three days we have fought our hardest for <span class="location"> Achi Baba </span>
         winding up with a bayonet charge by the whole force along the entire
         front, from sea to sea. Faced by a heavy artillery, machine gun and
         rifle fire our troops, French and British alike, made a fine effort; the
         French especially got well into the Turks with the bayonet, and all
         along, excepting on our extreme left, our line gained ground. I might
         represent the battle as a victory, as the enemy's advanced positions
         were driven in, but essentially the result has been failure, as the main
         object remains unachieved. The fortifications and their machine guns
         were too scientific and too strongly held to be rushed, although I had
         every available man in to-day. Our troops have done all that flesh and
         blood can do against semi-permanent works, and they are not able to
         carry them. More and more munitions will be needed to do so. I fear this
         is a very unpalatable conclusion, but I see no way out of it.</p>
      
      
      <p>"I estimate that the Turks had about 40,000 opposed to our 25,000
         rifles. There are 20,000 more in front of Australian-New Zealand Army
         Corps' 12,000 rifles at <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span>. By bringing men over from the Asiatic
         side and from <span class="location"> Adrianople </span> the Turks seem to be able to keep up their
         strength. I have only one more brigade of the <span class="unit"> Lancashire Territorial Division </span> to come;
         not enough to make any real effect upon the situation
         as regards breaking through."</p>
      
      
      <p>Hard must be the heart that is not wrung to think of all these brave
         boys making their effort; giving their lives; all that they had; it is
         too much; almost more than can be borne.</p>
      
      
      <p>Now to go back and make my notes, day by day, of the battle:--</p>
      
      
      <p>On the 6th instant we began at 11.30 after half an hour's
         bombardment,--we dared not run to more. A strong wind was blowing and it
         was hard to land or come aboard. Till 2 p.m. I remained glued to the
         telephone on board and then went ashore and saw both <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> and
         <span class="person"> d'Amade </span> in their posts of command. The live long day there were furious
         semi-detached fights by Battalions and Brigades, and we butted back the
         enemy for some 200 or 300 yards. So far so good. But we did not capture
         any of the main Turkish trenches. I still think we might have done as
         well at much less cost by creeping up these 200 or 300 yards by night.</p>
      
      
      <p>However!</p>
      
      
      <p>At 4.30 we dropped our high-vaulting <span class="location"> Achi Baba </span> aspirations and took to
         our spades.</p>
      
      
      <p>The <span class="unit"> Hood Battalion </span> of the <span class="unit"> Royal Naval Division </span> had been roughly handled.
         In the hospital clearing tent by the beach I saw and spoke to (amongst
         many others) young Asquith, shot through the knee, and <span class="person"> Commander
            Wedgwood </span>, who had been horribly hurt by shrapnel. Each in his own way
         was a calm hero; wrapped in the mantle bequeathed to English soldiers by
         <span class="person"> Sir Philip Sidney </span>. Coming back in the evening to the ship we watched
         the <span class="unit"> Manchester Brigade </span> disembarking. I have never seen a better looking
         lot. The <span class="unit"> 6th Battalion </span> would serve very well as picked specimens of our
         race; not so much in height or physique, but in the impression they gave
         of purity of race and distinction. Here are the best the old country can
         produce; the hope of the progress of the British ideal in the world; and
         half of them are going to swap lives with Turks whose relative value to
         the well-being of humanity is to theirs as is a locust to a honey-bee.</p>
      
      
      <p>That night Bailloud, Commander of the new French Division, came to make
         his salaam. He is small, alert, brimful of jokes and of years; seventy
         they say, but he neither looks it nor acts it.</p>
      
      
      <p>The 7th was stormy and the sea dangerously rough. At 10 a.m. the
         <span class="unit"> Lancashire Fusilier Brigade </span> were to lead off on our left. They could not
         get a move on, it seemed, although we had hoped that the shelling from
         the ships would have swept a clear lane for them.</p>
      
      
      <p>The thought that "Y" Beach, which was holding up this brigade, was once
         in our hands, adds its sting to other reports coming from that part of
         the field. In <span class="location"> France </span> these reports would have been impersonal messages
         arriving from afar. In Asia or Africa I would have been letting off the
         steam by galloping to <span class="person"> d'Amade </span> or <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span>. Here I was neither one
         thing nor the other:--neither a new fangled Commander sitting cool and
         semi-detached in an office; nor an old fashioned Commander taking
         personal direction of the show. During so long drawn out a suspense I
         tried to ease the tension by dictation. From the carbons I select these
         two paragraphs: they occur in a letter fired off to <span class="person"> Colonel Clive Wigram </span>
         at "11.25 a.m., 7th May, 1915."</p>
      
      
      <p>"I broke off there because I got a telephone message in from
         <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> to say his centre was advancing, and that by a pretty
         piece of co-operation between Infantry and Artillery, he had driven the
         Turks out of one very troublesome trench. He cannot see what is on his
         left, or get any message from them. On his left are the <span class="unit"> Lancashire
            Fusiliers </span> (Territorials). They are faced by a horrid redoubt held by
         machine guns, and they are to rush it with the bayonet.[15] It is a high
         thing to ask of Territorials but against an enemy who is fighting for
         his life, and for the existence of his country, we have to call upon
         every one for efforts which, under any other conditions, might be
         considered beyond their strength.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Were we still faced by the Divisions which originally held the
         <span class="location"> Gallipoli </span> Peninsula we would by now, I firmly believe, be in possession
         of the Kilid Bahr plateau. But every day a regiment or two dribble into
         <span class="location"> Gallipoli </span>, either from Asia or from Constantinople, and in the last two
         days an entire fresh Division has (we have heard) arrived from
         <span class="location"> Adrianople </span>, and is fighting against us this morning. The smallest
         demonstration on the part of <span class="location"> Bulgaria </span> would, I presume, have prevented
         this big reinforcement of fresh troops reaching the enemy, but it seems
         beyond the resources of diplomacy to get anyone to create a diversion."</p>
      
      
      <p>At 4.30 I ordered a general assault; the <span class="unit"> 88th Brigade </span> to be thrown in on
         the top of the <span class="unit">87th</span>; the New Zealand Brigade in support; the French to
         conform. Our gunners had put more than they could afford into the
         bombardment and had very little wherewith to pave the way.</p>
      
      
      <p>By the 4th instant I had seen danger-point drawing near and now it was
         on us. Five hundred more rounds of howitzer 4.5 and aeroplanes to spot
         whilst we wiped out the machine guns; that was the burden of my prayer.
         Still, we did what we could and for a quarter of an hour the whole of
         the Turkish front was wreathed in smoke, but these were naval shells or
         18 pr shrapnel; we have no 18 pr high explosive and neither naval shells
         nor shrapnel are very much good once the targets have got underground.
         On our left no move forward.[16] Elsewhere our wonderful Infantry fought
         like fresh formations. In face of a tempest of shot and shell and of a
         desperate resistance by the Turks, who stuck it out very bravely to the
         last, they carried and held the first line enemy trenches. At night
         several counter-attacks were delivered, in every case repulsed with
         heavy loss.</p>
      
      
      <p>We are now on our last legs. The beautiful Battalions of the 25th April
         are wasted skeletons now; shadows of what they had been. The thought of
         the river of blood, against which I painfully made my way when I met
         these multitudes of wounded coming down to the shore, was unnerving. But
         every soldier has to fight down these pitiful sensations: the enemy may
         be harder hit than he: if we do not push them further back the beaches
         will become untenable. To overdrive the willingest troops any General
         ever had under his command is a sin--but we must go on fighting
         to-morrow!</p>
      
      
      <p>On Saturday, the 8th, I went ashore and by 9.30 had taken up my quarters
         in a little gully between "W" and "X" Beaches within 60 yards of the
         Headquarters of the <span class="unit"> Royal Naval Division </span>. There I was in direct
         telephonic touch with both <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> and <span class="person"> d'Amade </span>. The storm had
         abated and the day was fine. Our troops had now been fighting for two
         days and two nights but there were messages in from the front telling us
         they were keen as ever to get something solid for their efforts. The
         <span class="unit"> Lancashire Fusiliers Brigade </span> had been withdrawn into reserve, and under
         my orders the <span class="unit"> New Zealand Brigade </span> was to advance through the line taken
         up during the night by the <span class="unit"> 88th Brigade </span> and attack <span class="location"> Krithia </span>. <span class="unit"> The 87th
            Brigade </span> were to try and gain ground over that wicked piece of moorland
         to the West of the great ravine which--since the days when it was in the
         hands of the troops who landed at "Y"--has hopelessly held up our left.
         Every gun-shot fired gives me a pain in my heart and adds to the deadly
         anxiety I feel about our ammunition. We have only one thousand rounds of
         4.5  H.E.  left and we dare not use any more. The 18 pr shrapnel is
         running down, down, down to its terminus, for we  must  try and keep
         10,000 rounds in hand for defence. The French have still got enough to
         cover their own attacks. The ships began to fire at 10.15 and after a
         quarter of an hour the flower of <span class="location"> New Zealand </span> advanced in open order to
         the attack. After the most desperate hand to hand fighting, often by
         sections or sometimes by groups of half a dozen men, we gained slowly,
         very slowly, perhaps a couple of hundred yards. There was an opinion in
         some quarters that we had done all we could, but I resolved firmly to
         make one more attempt. At 4 o'clock I issued orders that the whole line,
         reinforced by the Australians, should on the stroke of 5.30 fix bayonets
         and storm <span class="location"> Krithia </span> and <span class="location"> Achi Baba </span>. At 5.15 the men-of-war went at it hot
         and strong with their big guns and fifteen minutes later the hour glass
         of eternity dropped a tiny grain labelled 5.30 p.m. 8.5.1915 into the
         lap of time.</p>
      
      
      <p>As that moment befell, the wide plain before us became alive. Bayonets
         sparkled all over the wide plain. Under our glasses this vague movement
         took form and human shape: men rose, fell, ran, rushed on in waves,
         broke, recoiled, crumbled away and disappeared.</p>
      
      
      <p>At the speed of the minute hand of a watch the left of our line crept
         forward.</p>
      
      
      <p>On the right, at first nothing. Then suddenly, in the twinkling of an
         eye, the whole of the Northern slopes was
         covered by bright coloured irregular surging crowds, moving in quite
         another way to the khaki-clad figures on their left:--one moment pouring
         over the debatable ground like a torrent, anon twisted and turning and
         flying like multitudes of dead leaves before the pestilent breath of
         the howitzers. No living man has ever seen so strange a vision as this:
         in its disarray; in its rushing to and fro; in the martial music, shouts
         and evolutions!</p>
      
      
      <p>My glasses shook as I looked, though I  believe  I seemed very calm. It
         seemed; it truly seemed as if the tide of blue, grey, scarlet specks was
         submerging the enemy's strongholds. A thousand of them converged and
         rushed the redoubt at the head of the Kereves Dere. A few seconds later
         into it--one! two!! three!!! fell from the clouds the Turkish six
         inchers. Where the redoubt had been a huge column of smoke arose as from
         the crater of a volcano. Then fast and furious the enemy guns opened on
         us. For the first time they showed their full force of fire. Again, the
         big howitzers led the infernal orchestra pitting the face of no man's
         land with jet black blotches. The puppet figures we watched began to
         waver; the Senegalese were torn and scattered. Once more these huge
         explosions unloading their cargoes of midnight on to the evening gloom.
         All along the Zouaves and Senegalese gave way. Another surge forward and
         bayonets crossed with the Turks: yet a few moments of tension and back
         they fell to their trenches followed by salvo upon salvo of shell
         bursts. Night slid down into the smoke. The last thing--against the
         skyline--a little column of French soldiers of the line charging back
         upwards towards the lost redoubt. After that--darkness!</p>
      
      
      <p>The battle is over. Both sides have fought with every atom of energy
         they possessed. The heat is oppressive. A heavy mail from England. On
         shore all quiet. A young wounded Officer of the 29th Division said it
         was worth ten years of tennis to see the Australians and New Zealanders
         go in. Began writing at daylight and now it is midnight. No word yet of
         the naval offer to go through.</p>
      
      
      <p>Issued a special order to the troops. They deserve everything that
         anyone can give them in this world and the next.</p>
      
      
      <p>GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,  9th May, 1915.  </p>
      
      
      
      <p> 9th May, 1915. </p>
      
      <p>"<span class="person"> Sir Ian Hamilton </span> wishes the troops of the Mediterranean Expeditionary 
         Force to be informed that in all his past experiences, which include the
         hard struggles of the Russo-Japanese campaign, he has never seen more
         devoted gallantry displayed than that which has characterised their
         efforts during the past three days. He has informed Lord Kitchener by
         cable of the bravery and endurance displayed by all ranks here and has
         asked that the necessary reinforcements be forthwith dispatched.
         Meanwhile, the remainder of the <span class="unit"> East Lancashire Division </span> is disembarking
         and will henceforth be available to help us to make good and improve
         upon the positions we have so hardly won."</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 10th May, 1915. <span class="location"> H.M.T. "Arcadian" </span> Fell asleep last night thinking of
         Admirals, Commodores and men-o'-war and of how they  might , within the
         next forty-eight hours, put another complexion upon our prospects. So it
         seemed quite natural when, the first thing in the morning, a cable came
         in with the tea asking me whether I have been consulting <span class="person"> de Robeck </span> as to
         "the future operations that will be necessary." <span class="person"> K. </span> adds, "I hope you and
         the Admiral will be able to devise some means of clearing a passage."</p>
      
      
      <p>Have just cabled back "Every day I have consultations with the Admiral":
         I cannot say more than this as I am not supposed to know anything about
         <span class="person"> de Robeck's </span> cable as to the "means of clearing a passage" which went, I
         believe, yesterday. No doubt it lay before <span class="person"> K. </span> when he wired me. I have
         not been shown the cable; I have not been consulted about it, nor, I
         believe, has <span class="person"> Braithwaite </span>, but I do happen to be aware of its drift.</p>
      
      
      <p>Without embarking on another endless yarn let me note the fact that
         there are two schools amongst our brethren afloat. Roger Keyes and those
         of the younger school who sport the executive curl upon their sleeves
         are convinced that now, when we have replaced the ramshackle old
         trawlers of 18th March by an unprecedented mine-sweeping service of
         20-knot destroyers under disciplined crews, the forcing of the Straits
         has become as easy ... well; anyway; easier than what we soldiers tried
         to do on Saturday. Upon these fire-eaters <span class="person"> de Robeck </span> has hitherto thrown
         cold water. He thought, as we thought, that the Army would save his
         ships. But our last battle has shown him that the Army would only open
         the Straits at a cost greater than the loss of ships, and that the time
         has come to strike home with the tremendous mechanism of the Fleet. On
         that basis he quickly came to terms with the views of his thrusting
         lieutenants.</p>
      
      
      <p>On two reservations, he still insisted: (1) he was not going to deprive
         me of the close tactical support of his battleships if there was the
         least apprehension we might be "done in" in his absence. (2) He was not
         going to risk his ships amongst the mines unless we were sure, if he did
         get through, we could follow on after him by land.</p>
      
      
      <p>On both issues there was, to my thinking, no question:--(1) Although we
         cannot push through "under present conditions without more and more
         ammunition,"  vide  my cable of yesterday, all the Turks in Asia will
         not shift us from where we stand even if we have not one battleship to
         back us.</p>
      
      
      <p>(2) If the ships force <span class="location"> the Straits </span>, beyond doubt, we can starve out the
         Turks; scupper the Forts and hold the Bulair lines.</p>
      
      
      <p>We know enough now about the communications and reserves of food and
         munitions of the Turks to be positively certain they cannot stick it on
         the Peninsula if they are cut off from sea communication with Asia and
         with <span class="location"> Constantinople </span>. Within a fortnight they will begin to run short; we
         are all agreed there.</p>
      
      
      <p>So now, (i.e., yesterday) the Admiral has cabled offering to go through,
         and "now" is the moment of all others to let <span class="person"> Lord K. </span> clearly face the
         alternative to that proposal. So I have said (in the same cable in which
         I answer his question about consultations with the Admiral) "If you
         could only spare me two fresh Divisions organized as a Corps I could
         push on with great hopes of success both from <span class="location"> Helles </span> and <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span>;
         otherwise I am afraid we shall degenerate into trench warfare with its
         resultant slowness."</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Birdie </span> ran down from Anzac and breakfasted. He brings news of an A.1
         affair. Two of his Battalions, the 15th and 16th Australians, stormed
         three rows of Turkish trenches with the bayonet, and then sat down in
         them. At dawn to-day the enemy counter-attacked in overwhelming
         strength. The healthy part of the story lies herein, that our field guns
         were standing by in action, and as the enemy came on they let them have
         it hot with shrapnel over a space of 300 yards. Terrible as this fire
         was, it failed to beat off the Turks. They retook the trenches, but they
         have paid far more than their price, for <span class="person"> Birdwood </span> assures me that their
         corpses lie piled up so thick one on top of the other that our snipers
         can take cover behind them.</p>
      
      
      <p>A curious incident: during the night a Fleet-sweeper tied up alongside,
         full of wounded, chiefly Australians. They had been sent off from the
         beach; had been hawked about from ship to ship and every ship they
         hailed had the same reply--"full up"--until, in the end, they received
         orders to return to the shore and disembark their wounded to wait there
         until next day. The Officers, amongst them an Australian Brigadier of my
         acquaintance, protested; and so, the Fleet-sweeper crew, not knowing
         what to do, came and lashed on to us.[17] No one told me anything of
         this last night, but the ship's Captain and his Officers and my own
         Staff Officers have been up on watches serving out soup, etc., and
         tending these wounded to the best of their power. As soon as I heard
         what had happened I first signalled the hospital ship <span class="location">  Guildford Castle  </span>
         to prepare to take the men in (she had just cast anchor); then I went on
         board the Fleet-sweeper myself and told the wounded how sorry I was for
         the delay in getting them to bed. They declared one and all they had
         been very well done but "the boys" never complain; my A.G. is the
         responsible official; I have told him the  band-o-bast  has been bad;
         also that a Court of Enquiry must be called to adjudicate on the whole
         matter.</p>
      
      
      <p>Were an example to be sought of the almighty influence of "Time" none
         better could be found than in the fact that, to-day, I have almost
         forgotten to chronicle a passage in <span class="person"> K.'s </span> cable aforesaid that might well
         have been worth the world and the glories thereof only forty-eight short
         hours ago. <span class="person"> K. </span> says, "More ammunition is being pushed out to you  via 
         Marseilles." I am glad. I am deeply grateful. Our anxieties will be
         lessened, but  that same message, had it only reached us on Saturday
         morning, would have enabled us to fire 5,000 more shrapnel and 500 more
         4.5 howitzer H.E. to cover our last assault! </p>

      <p>CHAPTER VIII TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 11th May, 1915. H.M.T. <span class="location"> "Arcadian"  </span> Day dull and overcast. Vice-Admiral
         came over to see me in the morning. Neither of us has had a reply to his
         cable; instead, he has been told two enemy submarines are on their way
         to pay us a visit. The approach of these mechanical monsters opens up
         vistas thronged with shadowy forebodings. <span class="person"> De Robeck </span> begs me to set his
         mind at ease by landing with my Staff forthwith. Have sent Officers to
         survey the ground between <span class="location"> Helles </span> and <span class="location"> Sedd-el-Bahr </span> and to see if they can
         find room for us. We would all rather be on shore than board ship, but
         <span class="location"> Helles </span> and "V" Beaches are already overcrowded, and we should be
         squeezed in cheek by jowl, within a few hundred yards of the two
         Divisional Headquarters Staffs.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 12th May, 1915. <span class="location"> H.M.T. "Arcadian"  </span> Raining hard. Busy all morning. A
         cable from <span class="person"> Lord K. </span> to say he is sending out the <span class="unit"> Lowland Division </span>. We are
         all as pleased as Punch! especially (so <span class="person"> Braithwaite </span> tells me) <span class="person"> Roger
            Keyes </span> who looks on this as a good omen for the naval attack proposals.
         Had he not meant the Fleet to shove in <span class="person"> K. </span> must have made some reference
         to the <span class="unit"> second Division </span>, surely. Have cabled back at once to <span class="person"> K. </span> giving
         him warmest thanks and begging him to look, personally, into the
         question of the command of the coming Division. Have begged him to take
         <span class="person"> Leslie Rundle's </span> opinion on the point and have pressed it by saying,
         "Imperturbable calm in the Commander is essential above all things in
         these operations." Most of the troop transports have left their
         anchorage and gone back to Mudros for fear of submarines.</p>
      
      
      <p>Went ashore at 3 o'clock. Saw <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> and then inspected the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> just in from the firing line. The ground was heavy and sloppy
         after the rain. I walked as far as the trenches of the <span class="unit"> 86th Brigade </span> and
         saw amongst other <span class="unit"> Corps the Essex </span>, <span class="unit"> Hants </span>, <span class="unit"> Lancashire Fusiliers </span> and <span class="unit"> 5th
            Royal Scots </span>. Spent over an hour chatting to groups of Officers and men
         who looked like earth to earth, caked as they were with mud, haggard
         with lack of sleep, pale as the dead, many of them slightly wounded and
         bandaged, hand or head, their clothes blood-stained, their eyes
         blood-shot. Who could have believed that only a fortnight ago these same
         figures were clean as new pins; smart and well-liking! Two-thirds of
         each Battalion were sound asleep in pools of mud and water--like corpses
         half buried! This sounds horrible but the hearty welcome extended to us
         by all ranks and the pride they took in their achievements was a sublime
         triumph of mind over matter. Our voluntary service regulars are the last
         descendants of those rulers of the ancient world, the Roman
         Legionaries. Oh that their ranks could be kept filled and that a mould
         so unique was being used to its fullest in forming new regulars.</p>
      
      
      <p>On my way back to the beach I saw the <span class="unit"> Plymouth Battalion </span> as it marched
         in from the front line. They were quite different excepting only in the
         fact that they also had done marvels of fighting and endurance. They
         were done: they had come to the end of their tether. Not only physical
         exhaustion but moral exhaustion. They could not raise a smile in the
         whole battalion. The faces of Officers and men had a crushed, utterly
         finished expression: some of the younger Officers especially had that
         true funeral set about their lips which spreads the contagion of gloom
         through the hearts of the bravest soldiers. As each company front formed
         the knees of the rank and file seemed to give way. Down they fell and
         motionless remained. An hour or two of rest, their Colonel says, will
         make all the difference in what the French call their  allure , but not
         quite so soon I think. These are the New Armies. They are not
         specialised types like the Old Army. They have nerves, the defects of
         their good qualities. They are more susceptible to the horrors and
         discomforts of what they were never brought up to undergo. The
         philosophy of the battlefield is not part of their panoply. No one
         fights better than they do--for a spell--and a good long spell too. But
         they have not the invincible carelessness or temperamental springiness
         of the old lot--and how should they?</p>
      
      
      <p>In the evening I received General <span class="person"> d'Amade </span> who had come over to pay his
         farewell visit. He is permitted to let me see his order of recall.
         "Important modifications having come about in the general political
         situation" his Government have urgent need for his services on a
         "military mission." <span class="person"> D'Amade </span> is a most charming, chivalrous and loyal
         soldier. He has lost his son fighting in <span class="location"> France </span> and he has had his
         headquarters right down in the middle of his 75's where the infernal din
         night and day must indeed murder sleep. He is a delightful person and,
         in the combat, too brave. We all wish him luck. For<span class="location"> Kum Kale </span>and for
         what he has done, suffered and lost he deserves great Kudos in his
         country.</p>
      
      
      <p>By order of the Vice-Admiral this ship is to anchor at <span class="location"> Tenedos </span>. My
         informal confab with the heroes of the <span class="unit">29th Division</span>, and their utter
         unconsciousness of their own glorious conduct have moved me to write
         these few words in their honour:--</p>
      
      
      
      <p>GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,  12th May, 1915. </p>
      
      
      <p>For the first time for 18 days and nights it has been found possible to
         withdraw the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> from the fire fight. During the whole of that
         long period of unprecedented strain the Division has held ground or
         gained it, against the bullets and bayonets of the constantly renewed
         forces of the foe. During the whole of that long period they have been
         illuminating the pages of military history with their blood. The losses
         have been terrible, but mingling with the deep sorrow for fallen
         comrades arises a feeling of pride in the invincible spirit which has
         enabled the survivors to triumph where ordinary troops must inevitably
         have failed. I tender to Major-General <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> and to his Division
         at the same time my profoundest sympathy with their losses and my
         warmest congratulations on their achievement.</p>

      <p> GENERAL HEADQUARTERS, MEDN. EXPED. FORCE,  12th May, 1915. </p>
      
      
      <p> MON GENERAL,</p>
      
      
      <p>With deep personal sadness I learn that your country has urgent need of
         your great experience elsewhere.</p>
      
      
      <p>From the very first you and your brave troops have done all, and more
         than all, that mortal man could do to further the cause we have at
         heart. By day and by night, for many days and nights in succession, you
         and your gallant troops have ceaselessly struggled against the enemy's
         fresh reinforcements and have won from him ground at the bayonet point.</p>
      
      
      <p>The military records of <span class="location"> France </span> are most glorious, but you, Mon General,
         have added fresh brilliancy, if I may say so, even to those dazzling
         records.</p>
      
      
      <p>The losses have been cruel: such losses are almost unprecedented, but it
         may be some consolation hereafter to think that only by so fierce a
         trial could thus have been fully disclosed the flame of patriotism which
         burns in the hearts of yourself and your men.</p>
      
      
      <p>With sincere regrets at your coming departure but with the full
         assurance that in your new sphere of activity, you will continue to
         render the same valuable service you have already given to France.</p>
      
      
      <p> I remain, Mon General, Your sincere friend, <span class="person"> IAN HAMILTON </span>,  General. </p>
      
      
      
      <p> 13th May, 1915. <span class="location"> H.M.T. "Arcadian"  </span> Hot and bright. Dead calm sea. Last
         night a dense fog during which a Turkish Torpedo boat sneaked down the
         Straits and torpedoed the <span class="location">  Goliath  </span>. David and his sling on the grand
         scale. No details yet to hand. The enemy deserve decorations--confound
         them!</p>
      
      
      <p>Got hold of a Fleet-sweeper and went off to <span class="location"> Cape Helles </span>. Again visited
         Headquarters <span class="unit">29th Division</span>, and afterwards walked through the trenches
         of the 87th Brigade. Saw that fine soldier, Brigadier-General Marshall,
         in command. Chatted to no end of his men-- <span class="unit"> Inniskillings </span>, <span class="unit"> Dublin
            Fusiliers </span>, etc. They have recovered their exhaustion; have cleaned up,
         and look full of themselves, twice the size in fact. As I stepped on to
         the little pier at <span class="location"> Cape Helles </span> an enemy's six-incher burst about 50
         yards back, a lump of metal just clearing my right shoulder strap and
         shooting into the sea with an ugly hiss. Not a big fragment but enough!</p>
      
      
      <p>The Staff have made up their minds that we should be very much in the
         wrong box if we dossed down on the toe of the Peninsula. First,--unless
         we get between the Divisional Generals and the enemy, there is literally
         no room! Secondly,--I should be further, in point of time, from <span class="person"> Birdwood </span>
         and his men than if I was still on board ship. Thirdly,--the several
         Headquarters of Divisions, whether French or British, would all equally
         hate to have <span class="person"> Braithwaite </span> and myself sitting in their pockets from
         morning to night. Have sent out another party, therefore, to explore
         Tenedos and see if we can find a place there which will serve us till we
         can make more elbow room on Gallipoli.</p>
      
      
      <p>The Gurkhas have stalked the Bluff Redoubt and have carried it with a
         rush! They are absolutely the boys for this class of country and for
         this class of enemy.</p>
      
      
      <p>Cabled <span class="person"> Lord K. </span> about the weakness of the <span class="unit">29th Division</span>. At the very
         moment when we are hoping so much from a fresh push made in conjunction
         with a naval attack, the Division, the backbone of my force, are short
         by over 11,000 men and 400 Officers! As a fighting unit they are on
         their last legs and when they will be set upon their feet again <span class="person"> Lord K. </span>
         knows. Were we in France we'd get the men to-morrow. If I had my own
         depots in Egypt still I could see my way, but, as things are, there
         seems no chance of getting a move on for another fortnight. Have cabled
         <span class="person"> K. </span> saying, "I hope the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> is soon to be made up to strength.
         I had no idea when I left England that the customary 10 per cent.
         reinforcement was not being taken with it by the Division although it
         was to operate at so great a distance from its base." If <span class="person"> K. </span> gets into a
         bad temper over the opening of my cable, its tail end should lift him
         out again. For the enemy's extremely tenacious right has been shifted at
         last. Under cover of a hooroosh by the Manchesters, the Gurkhas have
         rushed a bluff 600 yards ahead of our line and are sticking to their
         winnings.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>  14th May, 1915. <span class="location"> H.M.T. "Arcadian"  </span> Hot day, smooth sea. Disembarking
         to bivouac on shore. What a contrast we must present to the Headquarters 
         in France! There the stately  Chateau ; sheets, table-cloths and motor
         cars. Here the red tab patricians have to haul their own kits over the
         sand.</p>
      
      
      <p>In the afternoon <span class="person"> d'Amade </span> came back with <span class="person"> General Gouraud </span>, his successor,
         the new Chief of the French. A resolute, solid looking  gaillard  is
         Gouraud. He brings a great reputation with him from the Western Front.</p>
      
      
      <p>Quite late the Admiral came over to see me. He brings bad news. <span class="person"> Roger
            Keyes </span> and the forwards will be cut to the heart. The Admiralty have
         turned down the proposal to force the Straits simultaneously by land and
         sea. We are to go on attacking; the warships are to go on supporting.</p>
      
      
      <p>From the earliest days great commanders have rubbed in the maxim, "If
         you attack, attack with all your force." Our people know better; we are
         to go on attacking with half our force. First we attack with the naval
         half and are held up--next we attack with the army half and are held up.</p>
      
      
      <p>The Admiral has changed his mind about our landing and thinks it would
         be best not to fix G.H.Q; first, because there might be
         delay in getting quickly to Anzac; secondly, because it is so close
         to Asia that we might all be scuppered in our beds by a cutting-out
         party of <span class="location"> Besika Bay </span> ruffians, unless we had a guard. But we can't run to
         the pomp and circumstance of a Commander-in-Chief's guard here.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 15th May, 1915. <span class="location"> H.M.T. "Arcadian"  </span> Till 3 p.m. the perspiring Staff
         were re-embarking their gear. Sailed then for <span class="location"> Helles </span> when I saw
         <span class="person"> Hunter-Weston </span> who gave me a full account of the attacks made on the
         newly gained bluff upon our left. Shells busy bursting on "W" Beach.
         Some French aeroplanes have arrived--God be praised! Shocked to hear
         Birdie has been hit, but another message to say nothing serious, came
         close on the heels of the first. Anchored at <span class="location">Imbros</span> when I got a cable
         asking me what forces I shall need to carry right through to a finish.
         A crucial question, very much affected by what <span class="person">the Admiral</span> told me last
         night. Nothing easier than to ask for 150,000 men and then, if I fail
         say I didn't get what I wanted, but the boldest leaders, Bobs, White,
         Gordon, K., have always "asked for more" with a most queasy conscience.
         On the face of it I need many more men if the Fleet is not to attack,
         and yet I am not even supposed to have knowledge, much less an opinion,
         as to what passes between the Fleet and the Admiralty!</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 16th May, 1915. <span class="location"> H.M.T. "Arcadian"  </span> De Robeck came off the <span class="location">  Lord
            Nelson  </span>, his new Flagship, in the morning. The submarines are shadowing
         him already, and there seems little doubt they are on their way.</p>
      
      
      <p>Bridges has been badly wounded. The news upset me so got hold of <span class="location"> H.M.S.
            Rattlesnake</span> ( <span class="person"> Commander Wedgwood) </span>, and started off for Anzac. Went
         ashore and saw <span class="person"> Birdie </span>. Doing so, I received a different sort of salute
         from that to which a Commander-in-Chief landing on duty is entitled by
         regulation. Quite a shower of shell fell all about us, the Turks having
         spotted there was some sort of "bloke" on the <span class="location">  Rattlesnake  </span>. We went
         round a bit of the line, and found all well, the men in great heart and,
         amidst a constant crackle of musketry, looking as if they liked it.
         <span class="person"> Birdie </span> himself is still a little shaken by his wound of yesterday. He
         had a close shave indeed. A bullet came through the chinks of a sandbag
         and scalped him. He fell to the ground senseless and pouring with
         blood, but when he had been picked up and washed he wanted to finish his
         round of the trenches.</p>
      
      
      <p>Embarked again under brisk shell fire and proceeded to the hospital ship
         <span class="location">Gascon</span> where I saw <span class="person"> General Bridges </span>. He looked languid and pale. But
         his spirit was high as ever and he smiled at a little joke I managed to
         make about the way someone had taken the shelling we had just gone
         through. The doctors, alas, give a bad, if not desperate, account of
         him. Were he a young man, they could save him by cutting off his leg
         high up, but as it is he would not stand the shock. On the other hand,
         his feet are so cold from the artery being severed that they anticipate
         mortification. I should have thought better have a try at cutting off
         the leg, but they are not for it. Bridges will be a real loss. He was a
         single-minded, upright, politics-despising soldier. With all her
         magnificent rank and file, <span class="location"> Australia </span> cannot afford to lose Bridges. But
         perhaps I am too previous. May it be so!</p>
      
      
      <p>Spent a good long time talking to wounded men--Australians, New
         Zealanders and native Indians. Both the former like to meet someone who
         knows their native country, and the natives brighten up when they are
         greeted in Hindustani. On returning to <span class="location">Imbros</span>, got good news about the
         <span class="unit">Lancashire Territorials</span> who have gained 180 yards of ground without
         incurring any loss to speak of. They are real good chaps. They suffer
         only from the regular soldiers' fault; there are too few of them here.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 17th May, 1915. <span class="location"> H.M.T. "Arcadian </span>" 10 p.m.  Too much work to move. In
         the evening the Admiral came to see me and read my rough draft for an
         answer to <span class="person"> Lord K.'s </span> cable. We show the Navy all our important operations
         cables; they have their own ways of doing things and don't open out so
         freely. On the face of it, we are invited to say what we want. Well, to
         steer a middle course between my duty to my force and my loyalty to K.
         is not so simple as it might seem. That middle course is (if I can only
         hit it) my duty to my country. The chief puzzle of the problem is that
         nothing turns out as we were told it would turn out. The landing has
         been made but the Balkans fold their arms, the Italians show no
         interest, the Russians do not move an inch to get across the Black Sea
         (the Grand Duke <span class="person"> Nicholas </span> has no munitions, we hear); our submarines have
         got through but they can only annoy, they cannot cut the sea
         communications, and so the Turks have not fled to Bulair. Instead, enemy
         submarines are actually about to get at us and our ships are being
         warned they may have to make themselves scarce: last--in point of
         time--but not least, not by a long way, the central idea of the original
         plan, an attack by the Fleet on the Forts appears to have been entirely
         shelved. At first the Fleet was to force its way through; we were to
         look on; next, the Fleet and the Army were to go for the Straits side by
         side; to-day, the whole problem may fairly be restated on a clean sheet
         of paper, so different is it from the problem originally put to me by K.
         when it was understood I would put him in an impossible position if I
         pressed for reinforcements. We should be on velvet if we asked for so
         many troops that we must win if we got them; whereas, if we did not get
         them we could say victory was impossible. But we are not the only
         fighters for the Empire. The Admiral, <span class="person"> Braithwaite </span>, <span class="person"> Roger Keyes </span> agree
         with me that the fair and square thing under the circumstances is to ask
         for  what is right ; not a man more than we, in our consciences, believe
         we will really need,--not a man less.</p>
      
      
      <p>Actually, after much heart searching and head scratching, my mind has
         made itself up and has gone home by cable to-day. The statement is
         entirely frank and covers all the ground except as regards the Fleet, a
         pidgin which flies out of range:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"(M.F. 234).</p>
      
      
      <p>"Your No. 4644 cipher, of the 14th instant. The following is my
         appreciation of the situation:</p>
      
      
      <p>"On the one hand, there are at present on the Peninsula as many troops
         as the available space and water supply can accommodate.</p>
      
      
      <p>"On the other hand, to break through the strong opposition on my front
         will require more troops. I am, therefore, in a quandary, because
         although more troops are wanted there is, at present, no room for
         them.[18] Moreover, the difficulty in answering your question is
         accentuated by the fact that my answer must depend on whether <span class="location"> Turkey </span>
         will continue to be left undisturbed in other parts and therefore free
         to make good the undoubtedly heavy losses incurred here by sending
         troops from <span class="location"> Adrianople </span>, <span class="location"> Keshan </span>, <span class="location"> Constantinople </span> and Asia; we now have
         direct evidence that the latter has been the case.</p>
      
      
      <p>"If the present condition of affairs in this respect were changed by the
         entry into the struggle of <span class="location"> Bulgaria </span> or <span class="location"> Greece </span> or by the landing of the
         Russians, my present force, kept up to strength by the necessary drafts,
         plus the Army Corps asked for in my No. M.F. 216 of the 10th May, would
         probably suffice to finish my task. If, however, the present situation
         remains unchanged and the Turks are still able to devote so much
         exclusive attention to us, I shall want an additional army corps, that
         is, two army corps additional in all.</p>
      
      
      <p>" I could not land these reinforcements on the Peninsula until I can
         advance another 1,000 yards and so free the beaches from the shelling to
         which they are subjected from the Western side and gain more space; but
         I could land them on the adjacent <span class="location"> islands of Tenedos </span>, <span class="location">Imbros </span> and <span class="location"> Lemnos </span>
         and take them over later to the Peninsula for battle. This plan would
         surmount the difficulties of water and space on the Peninsula and would,
         perhaps, enable me to effect a surprise with the fresh divisions.</p>
      
      
      <p>"I believe I could advance with half the loss of life that is now being
         reckoned upon, if I had a liberal supply of gun ammunition, especially
         of high explosive."</p>
      
      
      <p>Only bitterest experience has forced me to insert the two stipulations
         which should go without saving, (1) that my force is kept up to
         strength, (2) that I have a decent allowance of gun ammunition,
         especially of high explosives.</p>
      
      
      <p>Will <span class="person"> Lord K. </span> meet us half way, I wonder? He is the idol of <span class="location"> England </span>, and
         take him all in all, the biggest figure in the world. He believes, he
         has an instinct, that here is the heel of the German Colossus, otherwise
         immune to our arrows. Let him but put his foot down, and who dare say
         him nay?</p>
      
      
      <p>The most vital of my demands is that my formations should be kept full.
         An extra 50,000 men in the shape of a new army corps is one thing. An
         extra 50,000 men to feed war-trained units already in the field is
         another, and very different, and very much better thing. The value of
         keeping the veteran corps up to strength and the value of the same
         number of rifles organized into raw battalions commanded by
         inexperienced leaders is as the value of the sun to the moon. But <span class="person"> K. </span> and
         I have never seen eye to eye here, and never will. The spirit of man is
         like a precious stone: the greater it is the more room in it for a flaw.
         Who in the world but <span class="person"> K. </span> would have swept up all the odds and ends of
         detachments from about twenty different regiments of mine sent from
         Pretoria to Elandsfontein to bring up remounts and clothing to their
         units; who but <span class="person"> K. </span> could have conceived the idea of forming them into a
         new corps and expecting them to fight as well as ever--instead of
         legging it like the wind as they did at the first whistle of a bullet?
         On the other hand, who but <span class="person"> K. </span>, at that time, could have run the war at
         all?</p>
      
      
      <p>The <span class="unit">29th Division</span> have managed to snatch another 150 yards from the
         enemy, greatly strengthening the bluff upon which the Gurkhas dug
         themselves in.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 18th May, 1915. <span class="location"> H.M.T. "Arcadian"  </span> Villiers Stuart, <span class="person"> Birdie's </span> Staff
         Officer, has been killed on Anzac by a shell. The submarine E.14 sailed
         into harbour after a series of hair-raising adventures in the Sea of
         Marmora. She is none the worse, bar the loss of one periscope from a
         Turkish lucky shot. Her Commander, comes only after Nasmith as a
         pet of <span class="person"> Roger Keyes </span>! She got a tremendous ovation from the Fleet. The
         exploits of the submarine give a flat knock-out to Norman Angell's
         contention that excitement and romance have now gone out of war.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have asked that the Maoris may be sent from <span class="location"> Malta </span> to join the New
         Zealanders at <span class="location">Anzac</span>. I hope and believe that they will do well. Their
         white comrades from the Northern Island are very keen to have them.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 19th May, 1915. <span class="location"> H.M.T. "Arcadian".  </span> Compton Mackenzie has come on
         board. He is to be attached to the Intelligence. <span class="person"> General Gouraud </span> and his
         Chief of Staff, <span class="person"> Girodon </span>, lunched. I do not know many French Officers,
         but <span class="person"> Girodon </span> happens to be an old acquaintance. I met him six years ago
         on the Austrian manoeuvres. He is a delightful personality; a very
         sound soldier and a plucky one also. I reminded him how, in 1906, he had
         told me that the Germans would end by binding together all the other
         peoples of Europe against the common danger of their dominance. This was
         at Teschen on the borderland between Austrian and Prussian Silesia
         during the Austrian Manoeuvres. He remembered the occasion and the
         remark. Well, he has proved a true prophet!</p>
      
      
      <p>A cable from <span class="person"> K. </span> in answer to mine giving two more Army Corps as my
         minimum unless some neutral or Allied Power is going to help us against
         the Turks. I knew he would be greatly upset:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"(4726, cipher).</p>
      
      
      <p>"Private and personal. With reference to your telegram No. M.F. 234, I
         am quite certain that you fully realize what a serious disappointment it
         has been to me to discover that my preconceived views as to the conquest
         of positions necessary to dominate the forts on the Straits, with naval
         artillery to support our troops on land, and with the active help of
         naval bombardment, were miscalculated.</p>
      
      
      <p>"A serious situation is created by the present check, and the calls for
         large reinforcements and an additional amount of ammunition that we can
         ill spare from <span class="location"> France.</span></p>
      
      
      <p>"From the stand-point of an early solution of our difficulties, your
         views, as stated, are not encouraging. The question whether we can long
         support two fields of operation draining on our resources requires
         grave consideration. I know that I can rely upon you to do your utmost
         to bring the present unfortunate state of affairs in the Dardanelles to
         as early a conclusion as possible, so that any consideration of a
         withdrawal, with all its dangers in the East, may be prevented from
         entering the field of possible solutions.</p>
      
      
      <p>"When all the above is taken into consideration, I am somewhat surprised
         to see that the 4,500 which Maxwell can send you are apparently not
         required by you. With the aid of these I had hoped that you would have
         been in a position to press forward.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The Lowland Division is leaving for you."</p>
      
      
      <p>This is a queer cable. Seems as if <span class="person"> K. </span> was beginning to come up against
         those political forces which have ever been a British Commander's bane.
         The words in which he begs me to try and prevent "a withdrawal with all
         its dangers in the East ... from entering the field of possible
         solutions," sounds uncommonly like a cry for help. He means that I
         should help him by remembering, and by making smaller calls upon him.
         But the only way I can  really  help him is by winning a battle: to
         pretend I could win that battle without drafts, munitions and the Army
         Corps asked for would be a very short-lived bluff both for him and for
         me. We have had it from other sources that this strange notion of
         running away from the Turk, after singeing his beard, has arisen in
         London and in <span class="location"> France </span>. So now that the murder has peeped out, I am glad
         to know where we are and to feel that <span class="person"> K. </span> stands solid and sound behind
         us. He need have no fear; all that man can do <span class="person">I</span> will do by pressing on
         here and by asking for not one man or round more than is absolutely
         essential for the job.</p>
      
      
      <p>As to that passage about the 4,500 Australians, a refusal of Australians
         would indeed be good cause for surprise--only--it has never taken place,
         and never will take place. I can only surmise that my request made to
         Maxwell that these 4,500 men should come to me as drafts for my skeleton
         units, instead of as a raw brigade, has twisted itself, going down some
         office corridor, into a story that I don't want the men! <span class="person"> K. </span> tells me
         <span class="location"> Egypt </span> is mine and the fatness thereof; yet, no sooner do I make the most
         modest suggestion concerning anything or anyone Egyptian than <span class="person"> K. </span> is got
         at and I find he is the Barmecide and I Schac'abac. "How do you like
         your lentil soup?" says <span class="person"> K. </span> "Excellently well," say I, "but devil a drop
         is in the plate!" I have got to enter into the joke; that's the long and
         the short of it. But it is being pushed just a trifle too far when I am
         told I  apparently do not require  4,500 Australians!</p>
      
      
      <p>The whole of <span class="person"> K.'s </span> cable calls for close thinking. How to try and help
         him to pump courage into faint-hearted fellows? How to do so without
         toning down my demands for reinforcements?--for evidently these demands
         are what are making them shake in their shoes. Here is my draft for an
         answer: I can't change my estimate: it was the least I could safely ask
         for: but I can make it clear I do not want to ask for more than he can
         give:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"(M.F. 243).</p>
      
      
      <p>"With reference to your No. 4726, cipher. Private and personal. You need
         not be despondent at anything in the situation. Remember that you asked
         me to answer on the assumption that you had adequate forces at your
         disposal, and I did so.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Maxwell must have misinformed you. I want the Australian reinforcements
         to fill existing cadres. Maxwell, possibly not to disappoint senior
         officers, has sent them as weak brigades, which complicates command and
         organization exceedingly.</p>
      
      
      <p>"We gain ground surely if slowly every day, and now at 11 p.m. the
         <span class="unit">French</span> and <span class="unit">Naval</span> Divisions are fighting their way forward."</p>
      
      
      <p>Tidings of great joy from Anzac. The whole of the enemy's
         freshly-arrived contingent have made a grand assault and have been
         shattered in the attempt. <span class="person"> Samson </span> dropped bombs on them as they were
         standing on the shore after their disembarkation. Next, they were moved
         up into the fight where a tremendous fire action was in progress. Last,
         they stormed forward in the densest masses yet seen on the Peninsula.
         Then, they were mown down and driven back headlong. So they have had a
         dreadnought reception. This has not been a local trench attack but a
         real battle and a fiery one. I have lost no time in cabling the glorious
         news to <span class="person"> K. </span> The cloud of these coming enemy reinforcements has cast its
         shadow over us for awhile and now the sun shines again.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 20th May, 1919. <span class="location"> H.M.T. "Arcadian"  </span> <span class="person"> Aubrey Herbert </span> saw me before
         dinner. <span class="person"> He </span> brings a message from <span class="person"> Birdie </span> to say that there has been some
         sort of parley with the enemy who wish to fix up an armistice for the
         burial of their dead. <span class="person"> Herbert </span> is keen on meeting the Turks half way and
         I am quite with him,  provided  <span class="person"> Birdie </span> clearly understands that no Corps
         Commander can fix up an armistice off his own bat, and  provided  it is
         clear we do not ask for the armistice but grant it to them--the
         suppliants. <span class="person"> Herbert </span> brings amazing fine detail about the night and day
         battle on the high ridges. <span class="person"> Birdie </span> has fairly taken the fighting edge off
         Liman von Sanders' two new Divisions: he has knocked them to bits. A few
         more shells and they would have been swept off the face of the earth. As
         it is we have slaughtered a multitude. Since the 18th we are down to two
         rounds per gun per diem, but the Turks who have been short of stuff
         since the 8th instant are now once more well found. <span class="person"> Admiral Thursby </span>
         tells me he himself counted 240 shells falling on one of Birdwood's
         trenches in the space of ten minutes. I asked him if that amounted to
         one shell per yard and he said the whole length of the trench was less
         than 100 yards. On the 18th fifty heavy shells, including 12-inch and
         14-inch, dropped out of the blue vault of heaven on to the Anzacs.
         Everyone sorry to say good-bye to Thursby who goes to <span class="location"> Italy </span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Rumours that <span class="person"> Winston </span> is leaving the Admiralty. This would be an awful
         blow to us out here, would be a sign that Providence had some grudge
         against the Dardanelles. Private feelings do not count in war, but alas,
         how grievous is this set-back to one who has it in him to revive the
         part of Pitt, had he but Pitt's place. Haldane, too. Are the benefits of
         his organization of our army to be discounted because they had a German
         origin?  Fas est et ab hoste doceri . Half the guns on the Peninsula
         would have been scrap-iron had it not been for Haldane! But if this
         turns out true about Winston, there will be a colder spirit (let them
         appoint whom they will) at the back of our battleships here.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 21st May, 1915. <span class="location"> H.M.T. "Arcadian" </span><span class="location">Imbros</span>.  <span class="person">De Robeck</span> came on board
         with Lieutenant-Commander <span class="person"> Boyle </span> of E. 4 fame. I was proud indeed to meet
         the young and modest hero. He gets the V.C.; his other two officers the
         D.S.O.; his crew the D.C.M.</p>
      
      
      <p>Also he brought with him the Reuter giving us the Cabinet changes and
         the resignations of <span class="person"> Fisher </span> and <span class="person"> Winston </span> and this, in its interest, has
         eclipsed even V.C.s for the moment. <span class="person"> De Robeck </span> reminded me that <span class="person"> Lord K.'s </span>
         cable (begging me to help him to combat any idea of withdrawal) must
         have been written that very day. A significant straw disclosing the
         veering of the winds of high politics! Evidently <span class="person"> K. </span> felt ill at ease;
         evidently he must now be sitting at a round table surrounded by masked
         figures. Have just finished writing him to sympathize; to say he is not
         to worry about me as "I know that as long as you remain at the War
         Office no one will be allowed to harm us out here." Nor could they if he
         were the <span class="person"> K. </span> of old; the person who downed the two by making a
         peace by agreement with the Boers and then swallowed a Viceroy and his
         Military Member of Council as an appetiser to his more serious digest of
         <span class="location"> India </span>. But is he? Where are the instruments?--gone to <span class="location"> France </span> or gone to
         glory. he's is the exception.</p>
      
      
      <p>I would give a great deal for one good talk with <span class="person"> K. </span> --I would indeed. But
         this is not <span class="location"> France </span>. Time and space forbid my quitting the helm and so I
         must try and induce the mountain to come to Mahomet. My letter goes on
         to say, "Could you not take a run out here and see us? If once you
         realize with your own eyes what the troops are doing I would never need
         to praise them again. Travelling in the <span class="location">  Phaeton  </span> you would be here in
         three days; you would see some wonderful things and the men would be
         tremendously bucked up. The spirit of all ranks rises above trials and
         losses and is confident of the present and cheery about the future."</p>
      
      
      <p>Quite apart from any high politics, or from my coming to a fresh, clear,
         close understanding with <span class="person"> K. </span> on subjects neither of us understood when
         last we spoke together, I wish, on the grounds of ordinary tactics, he
         could make up his mind to come out. The man who has  seen  gains
         self-confidence and the prestige of his subject when he encounters
         others who have only  heard  and  read . <span class="person"> K. </span> might snap his fingers at
         the new hands in the Cabinet once he had been out and got the real
         Gallipoli at their tips.</p>
      
      
      <p>I can't keep my thoughts from dwelling on the fate of <span class="person"> Winston </span>. How will
         he feel now he realizes he is shorn of his direct power to help us
         through these dark and dreadful Straits? Since I started nothing has
         handicapped me more than the embargo which a double loyalty to <span class="person"> K. </span> and to
         <span class="person"> de Robeck </span> has imposed upon my communications to <span class="person"> Winston </span>. What a tragedy
         that his nerve and military vision have been side-tracked: his eclipse
         projects a black shadow over the Dardanelles.</p>
      
      
      <p>Very likely the next great war will have begun before we realize that
         the three days' delay in the fall of Antwerp saved <span class="location"> Calais </span>. No more
         brilliant effort of unaided genius in history than that recorded in the
         scene when Winston burst into the Council Chamber and bucked up the
         Burgomeisters to hold on a little bit longer. Any comfort our people may
         enjoy from being out of cannon shot of the Germans--they owe it to the
         imagination, bluff and persuasiveness of <span class="person"> Winston </span> and to this gallant
         Naval Division now destined to be starved to death!</p>
      
      
      <p>Sent my first despatch home to-day by King's Messenger. Never has story
         been penned amidst so infernal a racket.</p>

      <p>CHAPTER IX SUBMARINES</p>
      
      
         
      
      <p>22nd May, 1915. <span class="location">H.M.T. "Arcadian."</span> News in to say that yesterday,
         whilst<span class="person"> Herbert</span> was here to take orders about an armistice, some sort of
         an informal parley actually took place. Both sides suddenly got panic
         stricken, thinking the others were treacherous, and fire was opened,
         some stretcher bearers being killed. Nothing else was to be expected
         when things are done in this casual and unauthorized way. I felt very
         much annoyed, but Aubrey<span class="person"> Herbert</span> was still on board and I saw him before
         breakfast and told him Walker seemed to have taken too much upon himself
         parleying with the Turks and that <span class="person">Birdwood</span> must now make this clear to
         everyone for future guidance. Although Aubrey<span class="person"> Herbert</span> is excessively
         unorthodox he quite sees that confabs with enemies must be carried out
         according to Cocker.</p>
      
      
      <p>After breakfast landed at <span class="location">Cape Helles</span>. Inspected the detachment of the
         Works Department of the Egyptian Army as it was on its way to the French
         Headquarters. Colonel Micklem was in charge. At Sedd-el-Bahr lunched
         with<span class="person"> Gouraud</span> and his Staff. General <span class="person">Bailloud</span> rode up just as I was about
         to enter the porch of the old Fort. He was in two minds whether or not
         to embrace me, being in very high feather, his men having this morning
         carried the Haricot redoubt overlooking the Kereves Dere. At lunch he
         was the greatest possible fun, bubbling over with jokes and witty
         sallies. Just as we were finishing, news came through the telephone that
         <span class="unit">Bailloud's Brigade</span> had been driven in by a big Turkish counter-attack,
         with a loss of 400 men and some first class officers. Most of us showed
         signs, I will not say of being rattled, but of having stumbled against a
         rattlesnake.<span class="person"> Gouraud</span> remained unaffectedly in possession of himself as
         host of a lunch party. He said, "We will not take the trenches by not
         taking the coffee. Let us drink it first, and then we will consider." So
         we drank our coffee; lit our smokes, and afterwards<span class="person"> Gouraud</span>, through
         <span class="person">Girodon</span>, issued his orders in the most calm and matter-of-fact way. He
         declares the redoubt will be in our hands again to-morrow.</p>
      
      
      <p>Our lunch was to furnish us with yet another landmark for bad luck. As
         we were leaving, a message came in to say that an enemy submarine had
         been sighted off <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span>. The fresh imprint of a tiger's paw upon the
         pathway gives the same sort of feel to the Indian herdsman. Tall stories
         from neighbouring villages have been going the round for weeks, only
         half-believed, but here is the very mark of the beast; the horror has
         suddenly taken shape. He mutters the name of God, wondering what eyes
         may even now be watching his every movement; he wonders whose turn will
         come first--and when--and where. This was the sort of effect of the
         wireless and in a twinkling every transport round the coast was steering
         full steam to <span class="location">Imbros</span>. In less than no time we saw a regatta of
         skedaddling ships. So dies the invasion of <span class="location">England</span> bogey which, from
         first to last, has wrought us an infinity of harm. Born and bred of
         mistrust of our own magnificent Navy, it has led soldiers into heresy
         after fallacy and fallacy after heresy until now it is the cause of my
         Divisions here being hardly larger than Brigades, whilst the men who
         might have filled them are "busy" guarding <span class="location">London</span>! If one rumoured
         submarine can put the fear of the Lord into British transports how are
         German or any other transports going to face up to a hundred British
         submarines? The theory of the War Office has struggled with the theory
         of the Admiralty for the past five years: now there is nothing left of
         the War Office theory; no more than is left of a soap bubble when you
         strike it with a battleaxe. Some other stimulus to our Territorial
         recruiting than the fear of invasion will have to be invented in future.</p>
      
      
      <p>After lunch went to the Headquarters of the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> where all the
         British Divisional Generals had assembled together to meet me. The same
         story everywhere--lack of men, meaning extra work--which again means
         sickness and still greater lack of men. On my return found a letter from
         the Turkish Commander-in-Chief giving his "full consent" to the
         armistice he himself had asked me for! A save-face document, no doubt:
         the wounded are all Turks as our men did not leave their trenches on
         the 19th; the dead, also, I am glad to say, almost entirely Turks; but
         anyway, one need not be too punctilious where it is a matter of giving
         decent burial to so many men.</p>

         hour and a half's talk with <span class="person">de Robeck</span>--high politics as well as our own
         rather anxious affairs. No one knows how the new First Lord will play
         up, but Asquith, for sure, chucks away his mainspring if he parts with
         Winston: as to Fisher, he too has energy but none of it came our way so
         he will have no tears from us, though he has friends here too. The
         submarine scare is full on; the beastly things have frightened us more
         than all the Turks and all their German guns.</p>

      <p>Armistice from 9.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. for burial of Turkish dead. All
         went off quite smoothly.... This moment, 12.40 p.m. the Captain has
         rushed in to say that <span class="location">H.M.S. Triumph</span> is sinking! He caught the bad
         news on his wireless as it flew. Beyond doubt the German submarine. What
         exactly is about to happen, God knows. The fleet cannot see itself wiped
         out by degrees; and yet, without the fleet, how are we soldiers to
         exist? One more awful conundrum set to us, but the Navy will solve it,
         for sure.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>25th May, 1915. <span class="location">H.M.T. "Arcadian."</span> Bad news confirmed. The Admiral
         came aboard and between us we tried to size up the new situation and to
         readjust ourselves thereto. Our nicely worked out system for supplying
         the troops has in a moment been tangled up into a hundred knotty
         problems. Instead of our small craft working to and fro in half mile
         runs, henceforth they will have to cover 60 miles per trip. Until now
         the big ocean going ships have anchored close up to <span class="location">Helles</span> or Anzac; in
         future <span class="person">Mudros</span> will be the only possible harbour for these priceless
         floating depots. <span class="location">Imbros</span>, here, lies quite open to submarine attacks, and
         in a northerly gale, becomes a mere roadstead. The Admiral, who regards
         soldiers as wayward water babes, has insisted on lashing a merchantman
         to each side of the <span class="location">Arcadian</span> to serve as torpedo buffers. There are,
         it seems, at least two German submarines prowling about at the present
         moment between <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span> and Cape <span class="location">Helles</span>. After torpedoing the <span class="location">Triumph</span>
         the same submarine fired at and missed the <span class="location">Vengeance</span>. <span class="location">The Lord
            Nelson</span> with the Admiral, as well as three French battleships,
         zig-zagged out of harbour and made tracks for <span class="person">Mudros</span> in the afternoon.
         We are left all alone in our glory with our two captive merchantmen. The
         attitude is heroic but not, I think, so dangerous as it is
         uncomfortable. The big ocean liners lashed to port and starboard cut us
         off from air as well as light and one of them is loaded with Cheddar.
         When <span class="person">Mr. Jorrocks</span> awoke <span class="person">James Pigg</span> and asked him to open the window and
         see what sort of a hunting morning it was, it will be remembered that
         the huntsman opened the cupboard by mistake and made the reply, "Hellish
         dark and smells of cheese." Well, that immortal remark hits us off to a
         T. Never mind. Light will be vouchsafed. Amen.</p>
      
      
      <p>The burial of 3,000 Turks by armistice at Anzac seems to have been
         carried out without a hitch. All these 3,000 Turks were killed between
         the 18th and 20th instant. By the usual averages this figure implies
         over 12,000 wounded so the Lord has vouchsafed us a signal victory
         indeed. <span class="person">Birdwood</span>'s men were all out and his reserves, or rather the lack
         of them, would not permit him to counter-attack the moment the enemy's
         assault was repulsed. When we read of battles in histories we feel, we
         see, so clearly the value of counter-attack and the folly of passive
         defence; but, in the field, the struggle has sometimes been so close
         that the victorious defence are left gasping. The enemy were very polite
         during the armistice, and by way of being highly solemn and correct, but
         they could not refrain from bursting into laughter when the Australians
         held up cigarettes and called out "baksheesh."</p>
      
      
      <p>Last night the French and the Naval Brigade made a good advance with
         slight loss. The East Lancs also pushed on a little bit.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>26th May, 1915. <span class="location">H.M.T. "Arcadian."</span> Entertained a small party of
         Australian officers as my private guests for 48 hours, my idea being to
         give them a bit of a rest. <span class="person">Colonel Monash</span>, commanding <span class="unit">4th Australian
            Infantry Brigade</span>, was the senior. He is a very competent officer. I have
         a clear memory of him standing under a gum tree at Lilydale, near
         Melbourne, holding a conference after a manoeuvre, when it had been
         even hotter than it is here now. I was prepared for intelligent
         criticisms but I thought they would be so wrapped up in the cotton wool
         of politeness that no one would be very much impressed. On the contrary,
         he stated his opinions in the most direct, blunt, telling way. The fact
         was noted in my report and now his conduct out here has been fully up to
         sample.</p>
      
      
      <p>A horrid mishap. Landing some New Zealand Mounted Rifles at Anzac, the
         destroyer anchored within range of the Turkish guns instead of slowly
         steaming about out of range until the picket boats came off to bring the
         men ashore. The Turks were watching and, as soon as she let go her
         anchor, opened fire from their guns by the olive, and before the
         destroyer could get under weigh six of these fine New Zealand lads were
         killed and forty-five wounded. A hundred fair fighting casualties would
         affect me less. To be knocked out before having taken part in a battle,
         or even having set foot upon the Promised Land--nothing could be more
         cruel.</p>
      
      
      <p>A special order to the troops:--</p>
      
      
      <p>                                                 GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,
         25th May, 1915.</p>
      
      
      <p>1. Now that a clear month has passed since the Mediterranean
         Expeditionary Force began its night and day fighting with the enemy, the
         General Commanding desires me to explain to officers, non-commissioned
         officers and men the real significance of the calls made upon them to
         risk their lives apparently for nothing better than to gain a few yards
         of uncultivated land.</p>
      
      
      <p>2. A comparatively small body of the finest troops in the world, French
         and British, have effected a lodgment close to the heart of a great
         continental empire, still formidable even in its decadence. Here they
         stand firm, or slowly advance, and in the efforts made by successive
         Turkish armies to dislodge them the rotten Government at <span class="location">Constantinople</span>
         is gradually wearing itself out. The facts and figures upon which this
         conclusion is based have been checked and verified from a variety of
         sources. Agents of neutral powers possessing good sources of information
         have placed both the numbers and the losses of the enemy much higher
         than they are set forth here, but the General Commanding prefers to be
         on the safe side and to give his troops a strictly conservative
         estimate.</p>
      
      
      <p>Before operations began the strength of the defenders of the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>
         was:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  <span class="location">Gallipoli Peninsula</span>          34,000 and about 100 guns.
         Asiatic side of Straits      41,000</p>
      
      
      <p>All the troops on the <span class="location">Gallipoli Peninsula</span> and fifty per cent. of the
         troops on the Asiatic side were Nizam, that is to say, regular first
         line troops. They were transferable, and were actually transferred to
         this side upon which the invaders disembarked. Our Expeditionary Force
         effected its landing it will be seen, in the face of an enemy superior,
         not only to the covering parties which got ashore the first day, but
         superior actually to the total strength at our disposal. By the 12th
         May, the Turkish Army of occupation had been defeated in several
         engagements, and would have been at the end of their resources had they
         not meanwhile received reinforcements of 20,000 infantry and 21
         batteries of Field Artillery.</p>
      
      
      <p>Still the Expeditionary Force held its own, and more than its own,
         inflicting fresh bloody defeats upon the newcomers and again the Turks
         must certainly have given way had not a second reinforcement reached the
         Peninsula from <span class="location">Constantinople</span> and Smyrna amounting at the lowest
         estimate to 24,000 men.</p>
      
      
      <p>3. From what has been said it will be understood that the Mediterranean
         Expeditionary Force, supported by its gallant comrades the Fleet, but
         with constantly diminishing effectives, has held in check or wrested
         ground from some 120,000 Turkish troops elaborately entrenched and
         supported by a powerful artillery.</p>
      
      
      <p>The enemy has now few more Nizam troops at his disposal and not many
         Redif or second class troops. Up to date his casualties are 55,000, and
         again, in giving this figure, the General Commanding has preferred to
         err on the side of low estimates.</p>
      
      
      <p>Daily we make progress, and whenever the reinforcements close at hand
         begin to put in an appearance, the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force
         will press forward with a fresh impulse to accomplish the greatest
         Imperial task ever entrusted to an army.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>27th May, 1915. <span class="location">H.M.T. "Arcadian."</span> The Majestic has been torpedoed
         and has sunk off Cape <span class="location">Helles</span>. Got the news at mid-day. Fuller, my
         Artillery Commander, and Ashmead-Bartlett, the correspondent, were both
         on board, and both were saved--minus kit! About 40 men have gone under.
         Bad luck. A Naval Officer who has seen her says she is lying in shallow
         water--6 fathoms--bottom upwards looking like a stranded whale. He says
         the German submarine made a most lovely shot at her through a crowd of
         cargo ships and transports. Like picking a royal stag out of his harem
         of does. To my Staff, they tell me, he delivered himself further but, as
         I said to the Officer who repeated these criticisms to me, "judge not
         that ye be not judged."</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>28th May, 1915. <span class="location">H.M.T. "Arcadian."</span> Went for a walk with the Admiral.
         He refuses any longer to accept the responsibility of keeping us afloat.
         As <span class="location">Helles</span>, Anzac and <span class="location">Tenedos</span> have each been ruled out, we are going to
         doss down on this sandbank opposite us. One thing, it will be central to
         both my theatres of work.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>29th May, 1915. <span class="location">H.M.T. "Arcadian."</span> The Commodore, <span class="person">Roger Keyes</span>, arrived
         mid-day and invited me to come over to <span class="location">Helles</span> with him on a destroyer,
         <span class="location">H.M.S. Scorpion.</span> He was crossing in hopes--in hopes, if you
         please--of hitting off the submarine. The idea that it might hit him had
         not seemed to occur to him. On the way we were greatly excited to see
         the bladder of an indicator net smoking. So we rushed about the place
         and bombs were got ready to drop. But the net remained motionless and,
         as the water was too deep for the submarine to be lying at the bottom,
         it seemed (although no one dared to say so) that a porpoise had been
         poking fun at the Commodore.</p>

      <p>Landing at <span class="location">Helles</span> inspected the various roads, which were in the making.
         Next saw Hunter-Weston. Canvassed plans with him and felt myself
         refreshed. Then went on to<span class="person"> Gouraud</span>'s Headquarters, taking the Commodore
         with me. My Commanders are an asset which cancels many a debit.<span class="person"> Gouraud</span>
         is in excellent form and gave us tea. Walked down to "V" Beach at 6 p.m.</p>
      
      
      <p>When we got on to the pier, which ends in the <span class="location">River Clyde</span>, we found
         another destroyer, the <span class="location">Wolverine</span>, under Lieutenant-Commander <span class="person">Keyes</span>,
         the brother of the Commodore. She was to take us across, and (of all
         places in the world to select for a berth!) she had run herself
         alongside the <span class="location">River Clyde</span> which was, at that moment, busy playing
         target to the heavy guns of Asia. I imagined that taking aboard a boss
         like the Commander-in-Chief, as well as that much bigger boss (in naval
         estimates) his own big brother, the Commodore, our Lieutenant-Commander
         would nip away presto. Not a bit of it! No sooner had he got us aboard
         than he came out boldly and very, very slowly, stern first, from the lee
         of the <span class="location">River Clyde</span> and began a duel against Asia with 4-inch lyddite
         from the Wolverine's after gun. The fight seems quite funny to me now
         but, at the time, serio-comic would have better described my
         impressions. Shells ashore are part of the common lot; they come in the
         day's work: on the water; in a cockleshell--well, you can't go to
         ground, anyway!</p>
      
      
      <p>[Illustration: VIEW OF "V" BEACH, TAKEN FROM S.S. "<span class="location">RIVER CLYDE</span>"
         "Central News" photo.]</p>
      
      
      <p>Heavy fighting at Anzac. The Turks fired a mine under Quinn's Post and
         then rushed a section of the defence isolated by the explosion. At 6 in
         the morning the crater was, <span class="person">Birdie</span> says, most gallantly retaken with the
         bayonet. There are excursions and alarms; attacks and counter-attacks;
         bomb-showers to which the bayonet charge is our only retort--but we hold
         fast the crater!</p>
      
      
      <p>When I tell them at home that if they will give me munitions enough to
         let me advance two miles I will give them <span class="location">Constantinople</span>, that is the
         truth. On paper, the Turks no doubt might assert with equal force that
         if they got forces enough together to drive the Australians back a short
         two hundred yards they could give the Sultan the resounding prestige of
         a Peninsula freed from the Giaour. But that would require more Turks
         than the Turks could feed, whereas we know we could do it now, as we
         are--given the wherewithal--trench mortars, hand grenades and bombs, for
         example.</p>
      
      
      <p>A message from <span class="person">Hanbury Williams</span>, who is with the <span class="person">Grand Duke Nicholas</span>, to
         say that all idea of sending me a Russian Army Corps to land at the
         Bosphorus has been abandoned!!!</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>30th May, 1915. <span class="location">H.M.T. "Arcadian."</span>\ Went to Anzac in a destroyer. The
         Cove was being heavily shelled, and the troops near the beach together
         with the fatigue parties handling stores and ammunition, had dashed
         into their dugouts like marmots at the shadow of an eagle. <span class="person">Birdwood</span> came
         out to meet me on this very unhealthy spot; indeed, in spite of my
         waving him back, he walked right on to the end of the deserted pier.
         Just as we were getting near his quarters, a couple of shrapnel burst at
         an angle and height which, by the laws of gravity, momentum and velocity
         ought to have put a fullstop to this chronicle. Actually, we walked
         on--through the "Valley of Death"--past the spot where the brave Bridges
         bit the dust, to the Headquarters of the <span class="unit">4th Australian Infantry Brigade</span>. Thence I could see the enemy trenches in front of Quinn's Post,
         and also a very brisk bomb combat in full flame where the New Zealand
         Mounted Rifles were making good the Turkish communicating post they had
         seized earlier in the day. Nothing more strange than this inspection.
         Along the path at the bottom of the valley warning notices were stuck
         up. The wayfarer has to be as punctilious about each footstep as
         Christian in the "Pilgrim's Progress." Should he disregard the placards
         directing him to keep to the right or to the left of the track, he is
         almost certainly shot. Half of the pathway may be as safe as Piccadilly,
         whilst he who treads the other had far better be up yonder at hand grips
         with the Turks. Presumably some feature of the ground defilades one
         part, for the enemy cannot see into the valley, although, were they only
         20 yards nearer the edge of the cliff, they would command its whole
         extent. The spirit of the men is invincible. Only lately have we been
         able to give them blankets: as to square meals and soft sleeps, these
         are dreams of the past, they belonged to another state of being. Yet I
         never struck a more jovial crew. Men staggering under huge sides of
         frozen beef; men struggling up cliffs with kerosine tins full of water;
         men digging; men cooking; men card-playing in small dens scooped out
         from the banks of yellow clay--everyone wore a Bank Holiday
         air;--evidently the ranklings and worry of mankind--miseries and
         concerns of the spirit--had fled the precincts of this valley. The
         Boss--the bill--the girl--envy, malice, hunger, hatred--had scooted far
         away to the Antipodes. All the time, overhead, the shell and rifle
         bullets groaned and whined, touching just the same note of violent
         energy as was in evidence everywhere else. To understand that awful din,
         raise the eyes 25 degrees to the top of the cliff which closes in the
         tail end of the valley and you can see the Turkish hand grenades
         bursting along the crest, just where an occasional bayonet flashes and
         figures hardly distinguishable from Mother earth crouch in an irregular
         line. Or else they rise to fire and are silhouetted a moment against the
         sky and then you recognize the naked athletes from the Antipodes and
         your heart goes into your mouth as a whole bunch of them dart forward
         suddenly, and as suddenly disappear. And the bomb shower stops dead--for
         the moment; but, all the time, from that fiery crest line which is
         Quinn's, there comes a slow constant trickle of wounded--some dragging
         themselves painfully along; others being carried along on stretchers.
         Bomb wounds all; a ceaseless, silent stream of bandages and blood. Yet
         three out of four of "the boys" have grit left for a gay smile or a
         cheery little nod to their comrades waiting for their turn as they pass,
         pass, pass, down on their way to the sea.</p>
      
      
      <p>There are poets and writers who see naught in war but carrion, filth,
         savagery and horror. The heroism of the rank and file makes no appeal.
         They refuse war the credit of being the only exercise in devotion on the
         large scale existing in this world. The superb moral victory over death
         leaves them cold. Each one to his taste. To me this is no valley of
         death--it is a valley brim full of life at its highest power. Men live
         through more in five minutes on that crest than they do in five years of
         Bendigo or Ballarat. Ask the brothers of these very fighters--Calgoorlie
         or Coolgardie miners--to do one quarter the work and to run one
         hundredth the risk on a wages basis--instanter there would be a riot.
         But here,--not a murmur, not a question; only a radiant force of
         camaraderie in action.</p>
      
      
      <p>The Turks have heaps of cartridges and more shells, anyway, than we
         have. They have as many grenades as they can throw; we have--a dozen per
         Company. There is a very bitter feeling amongst all the troops, but
         especially the Australians, at this lack of elementary weapons like
         grenades. Our overseas men are very intelligent. They are prepared to
         make allowances for lack of shell; lack of guns; lack of high
         explosives. But they know there must be something wrong when the Turks
         carry ten good bombs to our one bad one; and they think, some of them,
         that this must be my fault. Far from it. Directly after the naval
         battle of the 18th March--i.e., over two months ago, I wrote out a cable
         asking for bombs. I sent this on my own happy thought, and I had hoped
         for a million by the date of landing five weeks later. But I got,
         practically, none; nor any promise for the future. In default of help
         from home, we have tried to manufacture these primitive but very
         effective projectiles for ourselves with jam pots, meat tins and any old
         rubbish we can scrape together.  <span class="person">De Lothbiniere</span> has shown ingenuity in
         thus making bricks without straw. The Fleet, too, has played up and de
         Robeck has guaranteed me two thousand to be made by the artificers on
         the battleships. <span class="person">Maxwell</span> in <span class="location">Egypt</span> has been improvising a few; Methuen at
         <span class="location">Malta</span> says they can't make them there. But what a shame that the sons of
         a manufacturing country like Great Britain should be in straits for
         engines so simple.</p>
      
      
      <p>Yesterday and to-day we have fired, for us, a terrible lot of shells
         (1,800 shrapnel) but never was shot better spent. We reckon the enemy's
         casualties between 1,000 and 2,000 mainly caused by our guns playing on
         the columns which came up trying to improve upon their lodgment in
         Quinn's Post. Add this to the 3,000 killed, and, say, 12,000 wounded on
         the 18th instant, and it is clear no troops in the world can stand it
         very long. But we are literally at the end of our shrapnel; and as to
         high explosive, according to the standards of the gunners, we have never
         had any!</p>
      
      
      <p>Left on a picket boat with <span class="person">Birdie</span> to board my destroyer to an
         accompaniment of various denominations of projectiles. One or two shells
         burst hard by just as we were scrambling up her side.</p>
      
      
      <p>Vice-Admiral Nicholls called after my return. Courtauld Thomson, the Red
         Cross man, dined; very helpful; very well stocked with comforts and
         everyone likes him, even the R.A.M.C.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>31st May, 1915. <span class="location">H.M.T. "Arcadian."</span> Worked in the forenoon.<span class="person"> Gouraud</span>,
         <span class="person">Girodon</span> and Hunter-Weston lunched and we spent the afternoon at the
         scheme for our next fight. Each of us agreed that Fortune had not been
         over kind. By one month's hard, close hammering we had at last made the
         tough moral of the Turks more pliant, when lo and behold, in broad
         daylight, thousands of their common soldiery see with their own eyes two
         great battleships sink beneath the waves and all the others make an exit
         more dramatic than dignified. Most of the Armada of store ships had
         already cleared out and now the last of the battleships has offed it
         over the offing; a move which the whole of the German Grand Fleet could
         not have forced them to make! What better pick-me-up could Providence
         have provided for the badly-shaken Turks? No more inquisitive cruisers
         ready to let fly a salvo at anything that stirs. No more searchlights by
         night; no more big explosives flying from the Aegean into the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>!</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>1st June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. Came ashore and stuck up my 80-lb. tent in the
         middle of a sandbank whereon some sanguine Greek agriculturalist has
         been trying to plant wheat.</p>
      
      
      <p>We shall live the simple life; the same life, in fact, as the men, but
         are glad to be off the ship and able to stretch our legs.</p>
      
      
      <p>Hard fighting in the North zone and the South. Both outposts captured by
         us on the 29th May at Anzac and on the French right at <span class="location">Helles</span> heavily
         attacked. In the North we had to give ground, but not before we had made
         the enemy pay ten times its value in killed and wounded. Had we only had
         a few spare rounds of shrapnel we need never have gone back. The War
         Office have called for a return of my 4.5 howitzer ammunition during the
         past fortnight, and I find that, since the 14th May, we have expended
         477 shell altogether at Anzac and <span class="location">Helles</span> combined. In the South the
         enemy twice recaptured the redoubt taken by the French on the 29th, but
         Gouraud, having a nice little parcel of high explosive on hand, was able
         to drive them out definitely and to keep them out.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>2nd June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. Working all day in camp. Blazing hot, tempered
         by a cool breeze towards evening. <span class="person">de Robeck</span> came ashore and we had an
         hour together in the afternoon. Everything is fixed up for our big
         attack on the 4th. From aeroplane photographs it would appear that the
         front line Turkish trenches are meant more as traps for rash forlorn
         hopes than as strongholds. In fact, the true tug only begins when we try
         to carry the second line and the flanking machine guns.<span class="person"> Gouraud</span> has
         generously lent us two groups of 75s with H.E. shell, and I am cabling
         the fact to the War Office as it means a great deal to us. When I say
         they are lent to us, I do not mean that they put the guns at our
         disposal. They are only ours for defensive purposes; that is to say,
         they remain in their own gun positions in the French lines and are to
         help by thickening the barrage in front of the Naval Division.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">de Robeck</span> and <span class="person">Keyes</span> are quite as much at sea as <span class="person"> Braithwaite</span> and myself
         about this original scheme of the British Government for treating a
         tearing, raging crisis; i.e., by taking no notice of it. I guess that
         never before in the history of war has a Commander asked urgently that
         his force might be doubled and then got no orders; no answer of any sort
         or kind!</p>
      
      
      <p>When I sent <span class="person">K.</span> my M.F. 234 of the 17th May asking for two Corps, or for
         Allies, one or the other, I got a reply by return expressing his
         disappointment; since then, nothing. During that fortnight of silence
         the whole of the Turkish Empire has been moving--closing in--on the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>. Then, by a side-wind I happen to hear of the abstraction of
         a Russian Army Corps from my supposed command; an Army Corps, who by the
         mere fact of "being," held off a large force of Turks from <span class="location">Gallipoli</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>So I have put down a few hard truths. Unpalatable they may be but some
         day they've got to be faced and the sooner the better. Time has slipped
         away, but to-day is still better than to-morrow.</p>
      
      
      <p>What a change since the War Office sent us packing with a bagful of
         hallucinations. Naval guns sweeping the Turks off the Peninsula; the
         Ottoman Army legging it from a British submarine waving the Union Jack;
         Russian help in hand; Greek help on the tapis. Now it is our Fleet
         which has to leg it from the German submarine; there is no ammunition
         for the guns; no drafts to keep my Divisions up to strength; my Russians
         have gone to Galicia and the Greeks are lying lower than ever.</p>
      
      
      <p>"No. M.F. 288. From General Sir  <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span> to  <span class="person">Earl Kitchener</span>. With
         reference to my telegrams No. M.F. 274 of 29th May, and No. M.F. 234 of
         17th May. If the information sent by Hanbury-Williams, to which I
         referred in my No. M.F. 274, is correct it is advisable that I should
         send you a fresh appreciation of the situation.</p>
      
      
      <p>"I assumed in my No. M.F. 234 that you had adequate forces at your
         disposal, but on the other hand I assumed that some 100,000 Turks would
         be kept occupied by the Russians. By the defection of Russia, 100,000
         Turks are set free in the Caucasus and European <span class="location">Turkey</span>. After deduction
         of casualties there are at least 80,000 Turks now against us in the
         Peninsula. There are 20,000 Turks on the Bulgarian frontier which,
         assuming that <span class="location">Bulgaria</span> remains neutral, are able to reinforce <span class="location">Gallipoli</span>;
         some, in fact, have already arrived showing the restoration of Turkish
         confidence in <span class="person">King Ferdinand</span>. Close by on the Asiatic side there remain
         10,000 Turks, making a total of 210,000, to which must be added 65,000
         who are under training in Europe.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The movement of the Turkish troops has already begun. There are
         practically no troops left in Smyrna district, and there are already in
         the field numbers of troops from European garrisons, while recently it
         was reported that more are coming.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The movement of a quarter of a million men against us seems to be well
         under way, and although many of these are ill-trained still with
         well-run supply and ammunition columns and in trenches designed by
         Germans the Turk is always formidable.</p>
      
      
      <p>"As regards ammunition, the enemy appears to have an unlimited supply of
         small-arm ammunition and as many hand-grenades as they can fling. Though
         there is some indication that gun ammunition is being husbanded, it was
         reported as late as 27th May, that supplies of shells were being
         received via Roumania, and yesterday it was suggested that artillery
         ammunition can be manufactured at <span class="location">Constantinople</span> where it is reported
         that over two hundred engineers have arrived from Krupp's.</p>
      
      
      <p>"At the same time, the temporary withdrawal of our battleships owing to
         enemy submarines has altered the position to our disadvantage; while not
         of the highest importance materially this factor carries considerable
         moral weight.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Taking all these factors into consideration, it would seem that for an
         early success some equivalent to the suspended Russian co-operation is
         vitally necessary. The ground gained and the positions which we hold are
         not such as to enable me to envisage with soldierly equanimity the
         probability of the large forces adumbrated above being massed against my
         troops without let or hindrance from elsewhere. Fresh light may be shed
         on the matter by the battle now imminent, but I am cabling on reasoned
         existing facts. Time is an object, but if <span class="location">Greece</span> came in, preferably
         via Enos, the problem would be simplified. It is broadly my view that
         we must obtain the support of a fresh ally in this theatre, or else
         there should be got ready British reinforcements to the full extent
         mentioned in my No. M.F. 234, though as stated above the disappearance
         of Russian co-operation was not contemplated in my estimate."</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>3rd June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.Meant to go to Anzac; sea too rough; in the
         afternoon saw <span class="person">de Robeck</span> and <span class="person">Roger Keyes</span>. <span class="person"> Braithwaite</span> came over and we
         went through my cable of yesterday. The sailors would just as soon I had
         left out that remark about the enemy being bucked up by the retreat of
         our battleships. But the passage implied also that their mere visible
         presence was shown to be most valuable. Both of them agree that I am
         well within the mark in saying what I did about the loss of my Russian
         Army Corps. <span class="person">Roger Keyes</span> next launched a dry land criticism. He rightly
         thinks that the weakness of our present units is the real weakness:
         he thinks we are far more in need of drafts than of fresh units; he
         suggests that a rider be sent now to insist that the estimates in
         yesterday's cable were only made on the assumption that my present force
         is kept up to strength. I did press that very point in my first cable of
         17th May, which is referred to in the opening of this cable; further, we
         keep on saying it every week in our War Office cable giving strengths.
         After all, <span class="person">K.</span> is 65. He still believes "A man's a man and a rifle's a
         rifle"; I still believe that half the value of every human being depends
         upon his environment:--we are not going to convert one another now.</p>
      
      
      <p>As we were actually talking, Williams brought over an answer:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"No. 5104, cipher. From  <span class="person">Earl Kitchener</span> to General Sir  <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span>. With
         reference to your No. M.F. 288. Owing to the restricted nature of the
         ground you occupy and the experience we have had in Flanders of
         increased forces acting in trench positions, I own I have some doubts of
         an early decisive result being obtained by at once increasing the forces
         at your disposal, but I should like your views as soon as you
         can--to-day if possible. Are you convinced that with immediate
         reinforcements to the extent you mention you could force the Kilid Bahr
         position and thus finish the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> operations?</p>
      
      
      <p>"You mentioned in a previous telegram that you intended to keep
         reinforcements on islands, is this your intention with regard to the
         Lowland Division, now on its way to you, and the other troops when
         sent?"</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">K.</span>'s brief cable is intense characteristic. I have taken down
         hundreds of his wires. We are face to face here with his very self at
         first hand. How curiously it reveals the man's instinct, or
         genius--call it what you will.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">K.</span> sees in a flash what the rest of the world does not seem to see so
         clearly; viz., that the piling up of increased forces opposite
         entrenched positions is a spendthrift, unscientific proceeding. He
         wishes to know if I mean to do this. To draw me out he assumes if I get
         the troops, I would at once commit them to trench warfare by crowding
         them in behind the lines of <span class="location">Helles</span> or Anzac. Actually I intend to keep
         the bulk of them on the islands, so as to throw them unexpectedly
         against some key position which is not prepared for defence. But I
         have to be very careful what I say, seeing that the Turks got wind of
         the date of our first landing from London via Vienna. Least said to a
         Cabinet, least leakage.</p>
      
      
      <p>That is not all. Curt as is the cable it has yet scope to show up a
         little more of our great <span class="person">K.</span>'s outfit. His infernal hurry. "To-day":--I
         am to reply, to-day! He has taken some two and a half weeks to answer my
         request for two Army Corps and I am to answer a far more obscure
         question in two and a half minutes. Why, since my appeal of 17th May the
         situation has not stood still. A Commander in the field is like a cannon
         ball. If he stops going ahead, he falls dead. You can't stop moving for
         a fortnight and then expect to carry on where you left off; I think the
         Duke of Wellington said this; if he didn't he should have. To err is to
         be human and the troops, if sent at once, may or may not, fulfil our
         hopes. All we here can say is this:--</p>
      
      
      <p>(1) If the Army Corps had been sent at once (i.e., two weeks ago) the
         results should have been decisive.</p>
      
      
      <p>(2) If the Army Corps are not sent at once, there can be no early
         decision.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person"> Braithwaite</span>, <span class="person">de Robeck</span> and Keyes agree to (1) and (2) but the cabled
         answer will not be so simple and, in spite of <span class="person">K.</span>'s sudden impatience, I
         must sleep over it first.</p>
      
      
      <p>Written whilst <span class="person">Williams waits</span>:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"No. M.F. 292. From General Sir  <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span> to  <span class="person">Earl Kitchener</span>. Secret.
         To-morrow, 4th June, I am fighting a general action. Therefore I feel
         sure that you will wish me to defer my answer to your telegram No. 5104,
         cipher, until I see the result."</p>
      
      
      <p>These lofty strategical questions must not make me forget an equally
         vital munitions message just to hand. I have cabled <span class="person">K.</span> twice in the past
         day or two about shells. On the 1st instant I had said, "I still await
         the information promised in your x. 4773, A. 5, of 19th instant. In my
         opinion the supply of gun ammunition can hardly be considered adequate
         or safe until the following conditions can be filled:--(1) That the
         amounts with units and on the Lines of Communication should be made up
         to the number of rounds per gun which is allowed in War Establishment
         figures of <span class="unit">29th Division</span>. (2) That these full amounts should be
         maintained and despatched automatically without any further application
         from us, beyond a weekly statement of the expenditure which will be
         cabled to you every Saturday. (3) In view of the number and the extent
         of the entrenchments to be dealt with it is necessary that a high
         proportion of high explosive shell for 18 pounder and howitzers be
         included in accordance with the report of my military advisers."</p>
      
      
      <p>We now have his reply:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"No. 5088, cipher. From  <span class="person">Earl Kitchener</span> to Sir  <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span>. With
         reference to your telegrams No. M.F. 281 and No. M.F.G.T. 967. We cannot
         supply ammunition to maintain a 1,000 rounds a gun owing to the demands
         from <span class="location">France</span>, but consignments are being sent which amount to 17 rounds
         per gun per day for the 18 pounder and 4.5.-inch howitzer; this is
         considered by <span class="person">General Joffre</span> and <span class="person">Sir John French</span> as necessary. As much
         as possible of other natures will be sent. As regards quantities, you
         will be informed as early as possible. As available, H.E. shells will be
         sent for 18 pounder guns and howitzers."</p>
      
      
      <p>If we get 17 rounds per gun per day for the 18 pounders and 4.5
         howitzers we shall indeed be on velvet. To be given what satisfies
         <span class="person">Joffre</span> and <span class="person">French</span>--that sounds too good to be true. So ran my thoughts
         and <span class="person"> Braithwaite</span>'s on a first reading. Then came the C.R.A. who puts
         another light on the proposal and points out that the implied comparison
         with <span class="location">France</span> is fallacious. We are undergunned here as compared with
         <span class="location">France</span> in the proportion of 1 to 3. I mean to say that, in proportion to
         "bayonets" we have rather less than one third of the "guns."
         Therefore, if we were really to have munitions on the scale
         "considered necessary by <span class="person">General Joffre</span> and <span class="person">Sir John French</span>," we ought
         to have three times 17 rounds per day per gun; i.e. 51 rounds per day
         per gun. But never mind. If we do get the 17 rounds we shall be
         infinitely better off than we have been: "and so say all of us!" Putting
         this cable together with yesterday's we all of us feel that the home
         folk are beginning to yawn and rub their eyes and that ere long they may
         really be awake.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 4th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. Left camp after breakfast and boarded the
         redoubtable <span class="location">Wolverine</span> under that desperado Lieutenant-Commander <span class="person">Keyes</span>.
         The General Staff came alongside and we made our way to Cape <span class="location">Helles</span>
         through a blinding dust storm--at least, the dust came right out to sea,
         but it was on shore that it became literally blinding.</p>
      
      
      <p>On the pier I met<span class="person"> Gouraud</span> who walked up with me.<span class="person"> Gouraud</span> was very grave
         but confident. My post of command had been "dug out" for me well forward
         on the left flank by Hunter-Weston. In that hole two enormous tarantulas
         and I passed a day that seems to me ten years. The torture of suspense;
         the extremes of exaltation and of depression; the Red Indian necessity
         of showing no sign: all this varied only by the vicious scream of shell
         sailing some 30 feet over our heads on their way towards the 60 pounders
         near the point. A Commander feels desperately lonely at such moments. On
         him, and on him alone, falls the crushing onus of responsibility: to be
         a Corps Commander is child's play in that comparison. The Staff are
         gnawed with anxiety too--are saying their prayers as fast as they can,
         no doubt, as they follow the ebb and flow of the long khaki line through
         their glasses. Yes, I have done that myself in the old days from
         Charasia onwards. Yet how faintly is my anguish reflected in the mere
         anxiety of their minds.</p>
      
      
      <p>Chapters could be written about this furious battle fought in a
         whirlwind of dust and smoke; some day I hope somebody may write them.
         After the first short spell of shelling our men fixed bayonets and
         lifted them high above the parapet. The Turks thinking we were going to
         make the assault, rushed troops into their trenches, until then lightly
         held. No sooner were our targets fully manned than we shelled them in
         earnest and went on at it until--on the stroke of mid-day--out dashed
         our fellows into the open. For the best part of an hour it seemed that
         we had won a decisive victory. On the left all the front line Turkish
         trenches were taken. On the right the French rushed the "Haricot"--so
         long a thorn in their flesh; next to them the Anson lads stormed another
         big Turkish redoubt in a slap-dash style reminding me of the best work
         of the old Regular Army; but the boldest and most brilliant exploit of
         the lot was the charge made by the <span class="unit">Manchester Brigade</span>[19] in the centre
         who wrested two lines of trenches from the Turks; and then, carrying
         right on; on to the lower slopes of Achi Baba, had nothing between
         them and its summit but the clear, unentrenched hillside. They lay
         there--the line of our brave lads, plainly visible to a pair of good
         glasses--there they actually lay! We wanted, so it seemed, but a reserve
         to advance in their support and carry them right up to the top. We
         said--and yet could hardly believe our own words--"We are through!"</p>
      
      
      <p>Alas, too previous that remark. Everything began to go wrong. First the
         French were shelled and bombed out of the "Haricot"; next the right of
         the Naval Division became uncovered and they had to give way, losing
         many times more men in the yielding than in the capture of their ground.
         Then came the turn of the Manchesters, left in the lurch, with their
         right flank hanging in the air. By all the laws of war they ought to
         have tumbled back anyhow, but by the laws of the Manchesters they hung
         on and declared they could do so for ever. How to help? Men! Men, not so
         much now to sustain the Manchesters as to force back the Turks who were
         enfilading them from the "Haricot" and from that redoubt held for
         awhile by the R.N.D. on their right. I implored<span class="person"> Gouraud</span> to try and make
         a push and promised that the <span class="unit">Naval Division</span> would retake their redoubt
         if he could retake the "Haricot".<span class="person"> Gouraud</span> said he would go in at 3
         p.m. The hour came; nothing happened. He then said he could not call
         upon his men again till 4 o'clock, and at 4 o'clock he said definitely
         that he would not be able to make another assault. The moment that last
         message came in I first telephoned and then, to make doubly sure, ran
         myself to Hunter-Weston's Headquarters so as not to let another moment
         be lost in pulling out the <span class="unit">Manchester Brigade</span>. I had 500 yards to go,
         and, rising the knoll, I would have been astonished, had I had any
         faculty of astonishment left in me, to meet Beetleheim, the Turk, who
         was with French in <span class="location">South Africa</span>. I suppose he is here as an interpreter,
         or something, but I didn't ask. Seeing me alone for the moment he came
         along. He had quite a grip of the battle and seemed to hope I might let
         the Manchesters try and stick it out through the night, as he thought
         the Turks were too much done to do much more. But it was not good
         enough. To fall back was agony; not to do it would have been folly.
         Hunter-Weston felt the same. When Fate has first granted just a sip of
         the wine of success the slip between the cup and lip comes hardest. The
         upshot of the whole affair is that the enemy still hold a strong line of
         trenches between us and Achi Baba. Our four hundred prisoners, almost
         all made by the <span class="unit">Manchester Brigade</span>, amongst whom a good number of
         officers, do not console me. Having to make the Manchesters yield up
         their hard won gains is what breaks my heart. Had I known the result of
         our fight before the event, I should have been happy enough. Three or
         four hundred yards of ground plus four hundred prisoners are distances
         and numbers which may mean little in <span class="location">Russia </span>or <span class="location">France</span>, but here, where
         we only have a mile or two to go, land has a value all its own. Yes, I
         should have been happy enough. But, to have to yield up the best
         half--the vital half--of our gains--to have had our losses trebled on
         the top of a cheaply won victory--these are the reverse side of our
         medal for the 4th June.</p>
      
      
      <p>Going back we fell in with a blood-stained crowd from the Hood, Howe and
         Anson <span class="unit">Battalions</span>. Down the little gully to the beach we could only walk
         very slowly. At my elbow was Colonel Crauford Stuart, commanding the
         Hood <span class="unit">Battalion</span>. He had had his jaw smashed but I have seen men pull
         longer faces at breaking a collar stud. He told me that the losses of
         the Naval Division has been very heavy, the bulk of them during their
         retreat. From the moment the Turks drove the French out of the
         "Haricot" the enfilade fire became murderous.</p>
      
      
      <p>On the beach was <span class="person">General de Lisle</span>, fresh from <span class="location">France</span>. He is taking over
         the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> from Hunter-Weston who ascends to the command of the
         newly formed <span class="unit">8th Army Corps</span>. <span class="person">De Lisle</span> seemed in very good form although
         it must have been rather an eye-opener landing in the thick of this huge
         stream of wounded. How well I remember seeing him galloping at the head
         of his Mounted Infantry straight for Pretoria; and my rage when, under
         orders from Headquarters, I had to send swift messengers to tell him he
         must rein back for some reason never made clear.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>5th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.Best part of the day occupied in a hundred and
         one sequels of the battle. The enemy have been quiet; they have had a
         belly-full. <span class="person">de Robeck</span> came off to see me at 5.30, to have a final talk
         (amongst other things) as to the Enos and Bulair ideas before I send my
         final answer to <span class="person">K.</span> If we dare not advertise the detail of our proposed
         tactics, we may take the lesser risk of saying what we are not going
         to attempt. The Admiral is perfectly clear against Bulair. There is no
         protection there for the ships against submarines except Enos harbour
         and Enos is only one fathom deep. After all, the main thing they want is
         that I should commit myself to a statement that if I get the drafts and
         troops asked for in my various cables, I will make good. That, I find
         quite reasonable.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>6th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. A very hot and dusty day. Still sweeping up
         the debris of the battle. Besides my big cable have been studying
         strengths with my A.G. The <span class="unit">Battalions</span> are dwindling to Companies and the
         Divisions to Brigades.</p>
      
      
      <p>The cable is being ciphered: not a very luminous document: how could it
         be? The great men at home seem to forget that they cannot draw wise
         counsels from their servants unless they confide in them and give them
         all the factors of the problem. If a client goes to a lawyer for
         advice the first thing the lawyer asks him to do is to make a clean
         breast of it. Before <span class="person">K.</span> asks me to specify what I can do if he sends me
         these unknown and--in Great Britain--most variable quantities,
         Territorial or New Army Divisions, he ought to make a clean breast of it
         by telling me:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  (1) What he has.
         (2) What <span class="person">Sir John French</span> wants.
         (3) Whether <span class="location">Italy</span> will move--or <span class="location">Greece</span>.
         (4) What is happening in the Balkans,--in the
         Caucasus,--in Mesopotamia.</p>
      
      
      <p>After all, the Armies of the Caucasus and of Mesopotamia are not
         campaigning in the moon. They are two Allied Armies working with me (or
         supposed to be working with me) against a common enemy.</p>
      
      
      <p>The first part of my cable I discuss the cause which led to the
         disappointing end to the battle of the 4th already described and then go
         on to say, "I am convinced by this action that with my present force my
         progress will be very slow, but in the absence of any further important
         alteration in the situation such as a definite understanding between
         <span class="location">Turkey</span> and <span class="location">Bulgaria</span>, I believe the reinforcements asked for in my No.
         234 will eventually enable me to take Kilid Bahr and will assuredly
         expedite the decision. I entirely agree that the restricted nature of
         the ground I occupy militates against me in success, however much I am
         reinforced; that was why in my Nos. M.F. 214 and M.F. 234 I emphasized
         the desirability of securing co-operation of new Allied Forces acting on
         a second line of operations. I have been very closely considering the
         possibility of opening a new line of operations myself, via Enos, if
         sufficient reinforcements should be available. The Vice-Admiral,
         however, is at present strongly averse to the selection of Enos owing to
         the open and unprotected nature of anchorage and to the presence of
         enemy submarines. Otherwise Enos offers very favourable prospects, both
         strategically and tactically, and is so direct a threat to
         <span class="location">Constantinople</span> as to necessitate withdrawal of Turkish troops from the
         Peninsula to meet it. Smyrna or even Adramyti which are not open to the
         same objections are too far from me, but the effect of entry of a fresh
         Ally at either place would inevitably make itself felt before very long
         in preventing further massing of the Turkish army against me, and
         perhaps even in drawing off troops; a considerable moral and political
         effect might also be produced, and all information points to those
         districts being denuded of troops.</p>
      
      
      <p>"With regard to the employment of the reinforcements asked for in my No.
         M.F. 234, General <span class="person">Birdwood</span> estimates that four Brigades are necessary to
         clear and extend his front sufficiently to prepare a serious move
         towards Maidos. I should therefore allocate a corps to the
         <span class="unit">Australian-New Zealand Army Corps</span> as the other two brigades would be
         required to give weight to his advance. The French Force as at present
         constituted, and the Naval Division which has been roughly handled,
         would be replaced in front of the line by the other corps. This
         reinforcement to be exclusive of any help we may receive from Allied
         troops operating on a second line of operations so distant as Smyrna.</p>
      
      
      <p>"With reference to your last paragraph I have no alternative, until Achi
         Baba is in my possession, but to keep reinforcements on islands or
         elsewhere handy. I have made arrangements at present, however, for one
         Infantry Brigade and Engineers of the <span class="unit">Lowland Division</span> on the Peninsula,
         one Infantry Brigade at <span class="location">Imbros</span> and the remaining Infantry Brigade at
         Alexandria to be ready to start at 12 hours' notice whenever I telegraph
         for it. Besides all the reasons given above, no troops in existence can
         continue fighting night and day without respite."</p>
      
      
      <p>Three weeks have passed now since I asked for two British Corps or for
         Allies and still no reply or notice of any sort except that message of
         the 3rd instant expressing doubts as to whether any good purpose will be
         served by sending us help "at once." Well; there hasn't been much "at
         once" about it but I have not played the Sybilline book trick or doubled
         my demand with each delay as I ought perhaps to have done. Now I think
         we are bound to hear something but I can't make out what has come over
         <span class="person">K.</span> of <span class="person">K.</span> In the old days his prime force lay in his faculty of focusing
         every iota of his energy upon the pivotal project, regardless (so it
         used to appear) of the other planks of the platform. A "side show" to
         him meant the non-vital part of the business, at that moment: it was
         not a question of troops or of ranks of Generals. For the time being the
         interests of an enterprise of five thousand would obliterate those of
         fifty. No man ever went the whole hog better. He would turn the whole
         current of his energy to help the man of the hour. The rest were bled
         white to help him. If they howled they found that <span class="person">K.</span> and his Staff were
         deaf, and for the same reason, as the crew of Ulysses to the Sirens.
         Several times in <span class="location">South Africa</span> <span class="person">K.</span>, so doing, carried the Imperial
         Standard to victory through a series of hair's breadth escapes. But
         to-day, though he sees, the power of believing in his own vision and of
         hanging on to it like a bulldog, seems paralysed. He hesitates. Ten
         short years ago, if <span class="person">K.</span>'s heart had been set on <span class="location">Constantinople</span>, why, to
         <span class="location">Constantinople</span> he would have gone. Paris might have screamed; he would
         not have swerved a hair's breadth till he had gripped the Golden Horn.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>7th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. Left camp early and went to Cape <span class="location">Helles</span> on a
         destroyer. On our little sandbag pier, built by Egyptians and Turkish
         prisoners, I met General <span class="person">Wallace</span> and his A.D.C. (a son of Walter
         Long's). <span class="person">Wallace</span> has come here to take up his duty as Inspector-General
         of Communications. About ten days ago he was forced upon us. He is
         reputed a good executive Brigadier of the Indian Army, but we want him,
         not to train Sepoys but to create one of the biggest organizing and
         administrative jobs in the world. His work will comprise the whole of
         the transhipment of stores from the ships to small craft; their dispatch
         over 60 miles of sea to the Peninsula, and the maintenance of all the
         necessary machinery in good running order. The task is tremendous, and
         here is a simple soldier, without any experience of naval men or
         matters, or the British soldier, or of Administration on a large scale,
         or even of superior Staff duties, sent me for the purpose. We want a
         competent business man at <span class="person">Mudros</span>, ready to grapple with millions of
         public money; ready to cable on his own for goods or gear by the ten
         thousand pounds worth. We want a man of tried business courage; a man
         who can tackle contractors. We are sent an Indian Brigadier who has
         never, so far as I can make out, in his longish life had undivided
         responsibility for one hundred pounds of public belongings. I cabled to
         <span class="person">K.</span> my objection as strongly as seemed suitable, but he tells me to carry
         on. He tells me to carry on and, in doing so, throws an amusing
         sidelight upon himself. Into his cable he sticks the words, "<span class="person">Ellison</span>
         cannot be spared." <span class="person">K.</span> believes that my protest  <span class="person">Wallace</span> has, at the
         back of it, a wish to put in the Staff Officer he took from me when I
         started. He doesn't believe in my zeal for efficiency at <span class="person">Mudros</span>; he
         thinks my little plan is to work General <span class="person">Ellison</span> into the billet.
         Certainly, I'd like an organizer of <span class="person">Ellison</span>'s calibre, but he had not,
         it so happens, entered my mind till <span class="person">K.</span> put him there!</p>
      
      
      <p>Landing at "W" Beach, I walked over to the<span class="unit">9th</span> and met Generals
         <span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span>, <span class="person">de Lisle</span> and <span class="person">Doran</span>. As we were having our confab, the
         Turkish guns from Asia were steadily pounding the ridge just South of
         Headquarters. One or two big fellows fell within 100 yards of the Mess.
         After an A.1 lunch (for which much glory to Carter, A.D.C.) visited
         Gouraud at French Headquarters. Going along the coast we were treated
         to an exciting spectacle. The Turkish guns in Asia stopped firing at
         Headquarters and turned on to a solitary French transport containing
         forage, which had braved the submarines and instead of transhipping (as
         is now the order) at <span class="person">Mudros</span>, had anchored close to "V" Beach. After
         several overs and unders they hit her three times running and set her on
         fire. Destroyers and trawlers rushed to her help. Bluejackets boarded
         her; got her fire under control; got her under steam and moved out. The
         amazing part of the affair lay in the conduct of the Turks. Having made
         their three hits, then was the moment to sink the bally ship. But no;
         they switched back once more onto the Peninsula, and left their helpless
         prize to make a leisurely and unmolested escape. Anyone but a Turk would
         have opened rapid fire on seeking his target smoking like a factory
         chimney, ringed round by a crowd of small craft. But these old Turks are
         real freaks. Their fierce courage on the defensive is the only cert
         about them. On all other points it becomes a fair war risk to presume
         upon their happy-go-lucky behaviour. If this crippled ship had been full
         of troops instead of hay they would equally have let her slip through
         their fingers.</p>
      
      
      <p>I stayed the best part of an hour with<span class="person"> Gouraud</span>. He can throw no light
         from the French side upon the reason for the strange hesitations of our
         Governments. As he says, after reporting an entirely unexpected and
         unprepared for situation and asking for the wherewithal to cope with
         it, a Commander should get fresh orders. Either: we cannot give you what
         you ask, so fall back onto the defensive; or, go ahead, we will give you
         the means. Taking leave we came back again by the 29th Headquarters
         where I saw <span class="person">Douglas</span>, commanding the <span class="unit">42nd Division</span>. Got home latish. As I
         was on my way to our destroyer took in a wireless saying that submarine
         E.11 had returned safely after three fruitful weeks in the Marmora.</p>
      
      
      <p>A most singular message is in:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. 5199).</p>
      
      
      <p>"From  <span class="person">Earl Kitchener</span> to General Sir  <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>"With reference to your telegram No. M.F. 301, instead of sending such
         telegrams reporting operations, privately to  <span class="person">Earl Kitchener</span>, will you
         please send them to the Secretary of State. A separate telegram might
         have been sent dealing with the latter part about Doran."</p>
      
      
      <p>May the devil fly away with me if I know what that means! <span class="person"> Braithwaite</span> is
         as much at a loss as myself. No one knows better than we do how much
         store <span class="person">K.</span> sets on having all these messages addressed to him personally.
         There's more in this than meets the common or garden optic!</p>
      
      
      <p>Very heavy firing on the Peninsula at 8 o'clock; a ceaseless tremor of
         the air which--faint here--denotes tremendous musketry there.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <h2 id="10">Chapter 10: A DECISION AND THE PLAN</h2>
      <p><a href="#">Back to top!</a></p>
      
      <p>CHAPTER X A DECISION AND THE PLAN</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>8th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. We are getting "three Divisions of the New
         Army"! The Cabinet "are determined to support" us! And why wouldn't they
         be? Thus runs the cable:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. 5217, cipher). Your difficulties are fully recognized by the
         Cabinet who are determined to support you. We are sending you three
         divisions of the New Army. The first of these will leave about the end
         of this week, and the other two will be sent as transport is available.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The last of the three divisions ought to reach you not later than the
         first fortnight in July. By that time the Fleet will have been
         reinforced by a good many units which are much less vulnerable to
         submarine attack than those now at the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>, and you can then
         count on the Fleet to give you continuous support.</p>
      
      
      <p>"While steadily pressing the enemy, there seems no reason for running
         any premature risks in the meantime."</p>
      
      
      <p>In face of <span class="person">K.</span>'s hang-fire cable of the 3rd, and in face of this long
         three weeks of stupefaction, thank God our rulers have got out of the
         right side of their beds and are not going to run away.</p>
      
      
      <p>The first thing to be done was to signal to the Admiral to come over. At
         2 p.m. he and <span class="person">Roger Keyes</span> turned up. The great news was read out and
         yet, such is the contrariness of human nature that neither the hornpipe
         nor the Highland Fling was danced. Three weeks ago--two weeks ago--we
         should have been beside ourselves, but irritation now takes the fine
         edge off our rejoicings. Why not three weeks ago? That was the tone of
         the meeting. At first:--but why be captious in the very embrace of
         Fortune? So we set to and worked off the broad general scheme in the
         course of an hour and a half.</p>
      
      
      <p>Just as the Admiral was going, Ward (of the Intelligence) crossed over
         with a nasty little damper. The Turks keep just one lap ahead of us. Two
         new Divisions have arrived and have been launched straightway at our
         trenches. At the moment we get promises that troops asked for in the
         middle of May will arrive by the middle of July the Turks get their
         divisions in the flesh:--so much so that they have gained a footing in
         the lines of the East Lanes: but there is no danger; they will be driven
         out. We have taken some prisoners.</p>
      
      
      <p>Dined on board the Triad. Sat up later than usual. Not only had we
         news from home and the news from the Peninsula to thresh out, but there
         was much to say and hear about E.11 and that apple of <span class="person">Roger Keyes</span>' eye,
         the gallant Nasmith. Their adventures in the sea of Marmora take the
         shine out of those of the Argonauts.</p>
      
      
      <p>Coming back along the well-beaten sandy track, my heart sank to see our
         mess tent still lit up at midnight. It might be good news but also it
         might not. Fortunately, it was pleasant news; i.e., <span class="person">Colonel Chauvel</span>,
         commanding <span class="unit">1st Australian Light Horse Brigade</span>, waiting to see me. I had
         known him well in Melbourne where he helped me more than anyone else to
         get the hang of the Australian system. He stays the night.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>9th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. A cable saying the new Divisions will form the
         <span class="unit">9th Corps</span> and asking me my opinion of Mahon as Corps Commander. I shall
         reply at once he is good up to a point and brave, but not up to running
         a Corps out here.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have been sent a gas-mask and a mosquito-net. Quite likely the mask is
         good bizz and may prolong my poor life a little bit, but this is
         problematical whereas there's no blooming error about the net. This
         morning instead of being awakened at 4.30 a.m. by a cluster of
         house-flies having a garden party on my nose I just opened one eye and
         looked at them running about outside my entrenchments, then closed it
         and fell asleep again for an hour.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>10th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. Nothing doing but sheer hard work. The
         sailors the same. Sent one pretty stiff cable as we all agreed that we
         must make ourselves quite clear upon the question of guns and shell.
         After all, any outsider would think it a plain sailing matter enough--a
         demand, that is to say, from <span class="person">Simpson-Baikie</span> at <span class="location">Helles</span> that he should be
         gunned and shell supplied on the same scale as the formations he quitted
         on the Western Front only a few weeks ago. <span class="person">Simpson-Baikie</span> has been
         specially sent to us by Lord <span class="person">K.</span>, who has a high opinion of his merits. A
         deep-thinking, studious and scientific officer. Well, <span class="person">Baikie</span> says that
         to put him on anything like the Western Front footing he wants another
         forty-eight 18-pounders; eight 5-inch hows.; eight 4.5. hows.; eight
         6-inch; four 9.2 hows.; four anti-aircraft guns and a thousand rounds a
         month per field gun; these "wants" he puts down as an absolute minimum.
         He also wishes me at once to cable for an aeroplane squadron of three
         flights of four machines each, one flight for patrol work; the other two
         for spotting.</p>
      
      
      <p>There is no use enraging people for nothing and "nothing" I am sure
         would be the result of this demand were it shot in quite nakedly. But I
         have pressed Baikie's vital points home all the same, vide attached:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F. 316).</p>
      
      
      <p>"Your No. 5088. After a further consideration of the ammunition question
         in light of the expenditure on the 4th and 5th June, I would like to
         point out that I have only the normal artillery complement of two
         divisions, although actually I have five divisions here. Consequently,
         each of my guns has to do the work which two and a half guns are doing
         in Flanders. Any comparison based on expenditure per gun must therefore
         be misleading. Also a comparison based on numbers of troops would prove
         to be beside the point, for conditions cannot be identical. Therefore,
         as I know you will do your best for me and thus leave me contented with
         the decision you arrive at, I prefer to state frankly what amount I
         consider necessary. This amount is at least 30 rounds a day for 18-pr.
         and 4.5 howitzer already ashore, and I hope that a supply on this scale
         may be possible. The number of guns already ashore is beginning to prove
         insufficient for their task, for the enemy have apparently no lack of
         ammunition and their artillery is constantly increasing. Therefore I
         hope that the new divisions may be sent out with the full complement of
         artillery, but, if this is done, the ammunition supply for the artillery
         of the fresh divisions need only be on the normal scale.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Since the above was written, I have received a report that the enemy
         has been reinforced by 1,300 Germans for fortress artillery; perhaps
         their recent shooting is accounted for by this fact."</p>
      
      
      <p>As to our Air Service, the way this feud between Admiralty and War
         Office has worked itself out in the field is simply heart-breaking. The
         War Office wash their hands of the air entirely (at the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>). I
         cannot put my own case to the Admiralty although the machines are wanted
         for overland tactics--a fatal blind alley. All I could do I did this
         afternoon when the Admiral came to tea and took me for a good stiff walk
         afterwards.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>11th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. Sailed over to Anzac with <span class="person"> Braithwaite</span>. Took
         <span class="person">Birdwood</span>'s views upon the outline of our plan (which originated between
         him and Skeen) for entering the New Army against the Turks. To do his
         share, durch und durch (God forgive me), he wants three new Brigades;
         with them he engages to go through from bottom to top of Sari Bair.
         Well, I will give him four; perhaps five! Our whole scheme hinges on
         these crests of Sari Bair which dominate Anzac and Maidos; the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> and the Aegean. The destroyers next took us to Cape <span class="location">Helles</span>
         where I held a pow wow at Army Headquarters, Generals Hunter-Weston and
         Gouraud being present as well as <span class="person">Birdwood</span> and <span class="person"> Braithwaite</span>. Everyone keen
         and sanguine. Many minor suggestions; warm approval of the broad lines
         of the scheme. Afterwards I brought <span class="person">Birdie</span> back to Anzac and then
         returned to <span class="location">Imbros</span>. A good day's work. Half the battle to find that my
         Corps Commanders are so keen. They are all sworn to the closest secrecy;
         have been told that our lives depend upon their discretion. I have shown
         them my M.F. 300 of the 7th June so as to let them understand they are
         being trusted with a plan which is too much under the seal to be sent
         over the cables even to the highest.</p>
      
      
      <p>Every General I met to-day spoke of the shortage of bombs and grenades.
         The Anzacs are very much depressed to hear they are to get no more bombs
         for their six Japanese trench mortars. We told the Ordnance some days
         ago to put this very strongly to the War Office. After all, bombs and
         grenades are easy things to make if the tails of the manufacturers are
         well twisted.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>12th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.Stayed in camp where <span class="person">de Robeck</span> came to see
         me. I wonder what <span class="person">K.</span> is likely to do about Mahon and about ammunition.
         When he told me <span class="person">Joffre</span> and French thought 17 rounds per gun per day good
         enough, and that he was going to give me as much, there were several
         qualifications to our pleasure, but we unitwere pleased, because apart
         from all invidious comparisons, we were anyway going to get more stuff.
         But we have not yet tasted this new French ration of 17 rounds per gun.</p>
      
      
      <p>Are we too insistent? I think not. One dozen small field howitzer
         shells, of 4.5. calibre, save one British life by taking two Turkish
         lives. And although the 4.5. are what we want the old 5-inch are none so
         bad. Where would we be now, I wonder, had not Haldane against Press,
         Public and four soldiers out of five stuck to his guns and insisted on
         creating those 145 batteries of Territorial Field Artillery?</p>
      
      
      <p>A depressing wire in from the War Office expressing doubt as to whether
         they will be able to meet our wishes by embarking units complete and
         ready for landing; gear, supplies, munitions all in due proportion, in
         the transports coming out here from <span class="location">England</span>. Should we be forced to
         redistribute men and material on arrival, we are in for another spell of
         delay.</p>
      
      
      <p>Altogether I have been very busy on cables to-day. The War Office having
         jogged my elbow again about the Bulair scheme, I have once more been
         through the whole series of pros and cons with the Admiral who has
         agreed in the reply I have sent:--clear negative. Three quarters of the
         objections are naval; either directly--want of harbours, etc.; or
         indirectly--as involving three lines of small craft to supply three
         separate military forces. The number of small craft required are not in
         existence.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>13th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. The War Office forget every now and then
         other things about the coastline above the Narrows. I have replied:</p>
      
      
      <p>"Your first question as to the fortification of the coast towards<span class="location">
            Gallipoli</span> can be satisfactorily answered only by the Navy as naval
         aeroplane observation is the only means by which I can find out about
         the coast fortifications. From time to time it has been reported that
         torpedo tubes have been placed at the mouth of Soghan Dere and at Nagara
         Point. These are matters on which I presume Admiral has reported to
         Admiralty, but I am telegraphing to him to make sure as he is away
         to-day at <span class="person">Mudros</span>. I will ask him to have aeroplane reconnaissance made
         regarding the coast fortifications you mention, to see if it can be
         ascertained whether your informant's report is correct, but there are
         but few aeroplanes and the few we have are constantly required for
         spotting for artillery, photographing trenches, and for reconnaissances
         of the troops immediately engaged with us."</p>
      
      
      <p>I am being forced by War Office questions to say rather more than I had
         intended about plans. The following cable took me the best part of the
         morning. I hope it is too technical to effect a lodgment in the memories
         of the gossips:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F. 328). From General Sir  <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span> to War Office. With
         reference to your No. 5441, cipher. From the outset I have fully
         realized that the question of cutting off forces defending the Peninsula
         lay at the heart of my problem. See my No. M.F. 173, last paragraph, and
         paragraphs 2 and 7 of my instructions to General Officer Commanding
         Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, of 13th April, before landing. I
         still consider, as indicated therein, that the best and most practicable
         method of stopping enemy's communications is to push forward to the
         south-east from Australian and New Zealand Army Corps.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The attempt to stop Bulair communications further North than the
         Australian and New Zealand Army Corps position would give the Turks too
         much room to pass our guns. An advance of little more than two miles in
         a south-eastern direction would enable us to command the land
         communications between Bulair and Kilid Bahr. This, in turn, would
         render Ak Bashi Liman useless to the enemy as a port of disembarkation
         for either Chanak or <span class="location">Constantinople</span>. It would enable us, moreover, to
         co-operate effectively with the Navy in stopping communication with the
         Asiatic shore, since Kilia Liman and Maidos would be under fire from our
         land guns.</p>
      
      
      <p>"It was these considerations which decided me originally to land at
         Australian and New Zealand Army Corps position, and in spite of the
         difficulties of advancing thence, I see no reason to expect that a new
         point of departure would make the task any easier. I have recently been
         obliged by circumstances to concentrate my main efforts on pushing
         forward towards Achi Baba so as to clear my main port of disembarkation
         of shell fire. I only await the promised reinforcements, however, to
         enable me to take the next step in the prosecution of my main plan from
         the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps.</p>
      
      
      <p>"I cannot extend the present Australian position until they arrive. See
         my No. M.F. 300, as to estimate of troops required, and my No. 304, 7th
         June, as to state of siege at Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. If
         I succeed the enemy's communications via Bulair and, with the Navy's
         help, via Asiatic coast should both be closed, as far as possible, by
         the one operation. If, in addition, submarines can stop sea
         communications with <span class="location">Constantinople</span> the problem will be solved.</p>
      
      
      <p>"With regard to supplies and ammunition which can be obtained by the
         enemy across the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>, since Panderma and Karabingha are normally
         important centres of collection of food supplies, both cereals and meat,
         and since the Panderma-Chanak road is adequate, it would be possible to
         provision the peninsula from a great supply depot at Chanak where there
         are steam mills, steam bakeries and ample shallow draught craft. If
         land communications were blocked near Bulair, ammunition could only be
         brought by sea to Panderma, and thence by road to Chanak or by sea
         direct to Kilid Bahr.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Either for supplies or ammunition, however, the difficulty of
         effectively stopping supply by sea may be increased by the large number
         of shallow craft available at Rodosto, Chanak, <span class="location">Constantinople</span> and
         Panderma. But as soon as I can make good advance south-east from
         Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, my guns, plus the submarines,
         should be able to make all traffic from the Asiatic shore very difficult
         for the enemy.</p>
      
      
      <p>"It is vitally important that future developments should be kept
         absolutely secret. I mention this because, although the date of our
         original landing was known to hardly anyone here before the ships
         sailed, yet the date was cabled to the Turks from Vienna."</p>
      
      
      <p>The message took some doing and could not, therefore, get clear of camp
         till 11 o'clock when I boarded the destroyer unitGrampusunit, and sailed for
         <span class="location">Helles</span>. Lunched with Hunter-Weston at his Headquarters, and then walked
         out along the new road being built under the cliffs from "W" Beach to
         Gurkha Gully. On the way I stopped at the <span class="unit">29th Division</span>al Headquarters
         where I met <span class="person">de Lisle</span>. Thence along the coast where the <span class="unit">88th Brigade</span> were
         bathing. In the beautiful hot afternoon weather the men were happy as
         sandboys. Their own mothers would hardly know them--burnt black with the
         sun, in rags or else stark naked, with pipes in their mouths. But they
         like it! After passing the time of day to a lot of these boys, I climbed
         the cliff and came back along the crests, stopping to inspect some of
         the <span class="unit">East Lancashire Division</span> in their rest trenches.</p>
      
      <div class="bath"><img src="images/Men_Bathing.jpg" alt="ya_4_people" width="535" height= "400"/>
         <p style="text-align:center">MEN BATHING AT HELLES.</p></div>
      
      <p>Got back to Hunter-Weston's about 6 and had a cup of tea. There Cox of
         the Indian Brigade joined me, and I took him with me to <span class="location">Imbros</span> where he
         is going to stay a day or two with <span class="person"> Braithwaite</span>.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>14th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. <span class="person">K.</span> sends me this brisk little pick-me-up:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"Report here states that your position could be made untenable by
         Turkish guns from the Asiatic shore. Please report on this."</p>
      
      
      <p>No doubt--no doubt! Yet I was once his own Chief of Staff into whose
         hands he unreservedly placed the conduct of one of the most crucial, as
         it was the last, of the old <span class="location">South Africa</span>n enterprises: I was once the
         man into whose hands he placed the defence of his heavily criticized
         action at the Battle of Paardeburg. There it is: he used to have great
         faith in me, and now he makes me much the sort of remark which might be
         made by a young lady to a Marine. The answer, as <span class="person">K.</span> well knows, depends
         upon too many imponderabilia to be worth the cost of a cable. The size
         and number of the Turkish guns; their supplies of shell; the power of
         our submarines to restrict those supplies; the worth of our own ship and
         shore guns; the depth of our trenches; the moralunit of our men, and so on
         unitad infinitumunit. The point of the whole matter is this:--the Turks
         haven't got the guns--and we know it:--if ever they do get the guns it
         will take them weeks, months, before they can get them mounted and
         shells in proportion amassed.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">K.</span> should know better than any other man in <span class="location">England</span>-- <span class="person">Lord Bobs</span>, alas, is
         gone--that if there was any real fear of guns from Asia being able to
         make us loosen our grip on the Peninsula, I would cable him quickly.
         Then why does he ask? Well--and why shouldn't he ask? I must not be so
         captious. Much better turn the tables on him by asking him to enable us
         to knock out the danger he fears:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F. 331). From General Sir  <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span> to  <span class="person">Earl Kitchener</span>. With
         reference to your telegram No. 5460. As already reported in my telegram,
         fire from the Asiatic shore is at times troublesome, but I am taking
         steps to deal with it. Of course another battery of 6-inch howitzers
         would greatly help in this."</p>
      
      
      <p>By coincidence a letter has come in to me this very night, on the very
         subject; a letter written by a famous soldier--Gouraud--the lion of the
         Ardennes, who is, it so happens, much better posted as to the Asiatic
         guns than the Jeremiah who has made <span class="person">K.</span> anxious. The French bear the
         brunt of this fire and<span class="person"> Gouraud</span>'s cool decision to ignore it in favour of
         bigger issues marks the contrast between the fighter who makes little of
         the enemy and the writer who makes much of him. I look upon<span class="person"> Gouraud</span> more
         as a coadjutor than as a subordinate, so it is worth anything to me to
         find that we see eye to eye at present. For, there is much more in the
         letter than his feelings about the guns of Asia: there is an outline
         sketch, drawn with slight but masterly touches, covering the past,
         present and future of our show:--</p>

         QUARTIER GENERAL.</p>
      
      
      <p>       MON GENERAL,</p>
      
      
      <p>     Vous avez bien voulu me communiquer une depeche de <span class="person">Lord Kitchener</span>
         faisant connaitre que le Gouvernement anglais allait envoyer
         incessamment aux <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> trois nouvelles divisions et des
         vaisseaux moins vulnerables aux sous-marins. D'apres les
         renseignements qui m'ont ete donnes, on annonce 14 de ces monitors;
         4 seraient armes de pieces de 35 a 38 m/ 4 de pieces de 24, les
         autres de 15.</p>
      
      
      <p>     C'est donc sur terre et sur mer un important renfort.</p>
      
      
      <p>     J'ai l'honneur de vous soumettre ci-dessous mes idees sur son
         emploi.</p>
      
      
      <p>     Jetons d'abord un coup d'oeil sur la situation. Il s'en degage, ce
         me semble, deux faits.</p>
      
      
      <p>     D'une part, le combat du 4 juin, qui, malgre une preparation
         serieuse n'a pas donne de resultat en balance avec le vigoureux et
         couteux effort fourni par les troupes alliees, a montre que, guides
         par les Allemands, les Turcs ont donne a leur ligne une tres grande
         force. La presqu'ile est barree devant notre front de plusieurs
         lignes de tranchees fortement etablies, precedees en plusieurs
         points de fil de fer barbeles, flanquees de mitrailleuses,
         communiquant avec l'arriere par des boyaux, formant un systeme de
         fortification comparable a celui du grand Front.</p>
      
      
      <p>     Dans ces tranchees les Turcs se montrent bons soldats, braves,
         tenaces. Leur artillerie a constamment et tres sensiblement
         augmente en nombres et en puissance depuis trois semaines.</p>
      
      
      <p>     Dans ces conditions, et etant donne que les Turcs ont toute liberte
         d'amener sur ce front etroite toute leur armee, on ne peut se
         dissimuler que les progres seront lents et que chaque progres sera
         couteux.</p>
      
      
      <p>     Les Allemands appliqueront certainement dans les montagnes et les
         ravins de la presqu'ile le systeme qui leur a reussi jusqu'ici en
         <span class="location">France</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>     D'autre part l'ennemi parait avoir change de tactique. Il a voulu
         au debut nous rejeter a la mer; apres les pertes enormes qu'il a
         subi dans les combats d'avril et de mai, il semble y avoir renonce
         du moins pour le moment.</p>
      
      
      <p>     Son plan actuel consiste a chercher a nous bloquer de front, pour
         nous maintenir sur l'etroit terrain que nous avons conquis, et a
         nous y rendre la vie intenable en bombardant les camps et surtout
         les plages de debarquement. C'est ainsi que les quatre batteries de
         grosses pieces recemment installees entre Erenkeui et Yenishahr ont
         apporte au ravitaillement des troupes une gene qu'on peut dire
         dangereuse, puisque la consommation dans dernieres journees a
         legerement depasse le ravitaillement.</p>
      
      
      <p>     Au resume nous sommes bloques de front et pris par derriere. Et
         cette situation ira en empirant du fait des maladies, resultant du
         climat, de la chaleur, du bivouac continuel, peut etre des
         epidemies, et du fait que la mer rendra tres difficile tout
         debarquement des la mauvaise saison, fin aout.</p>
      
      
      <p>     Ceci pose, comment employer les gros renforts attendus. Plusieurs
         solutions se presentent a l'esprit.</p>
      
      
      <p>     Primo, en Asie.</p>
      
      
      <p>     C'est la premiere idee qui se presente; etant donne l'interet de se
         rendre maitre de la region Yenishahr-Erenkeui, qui prend nos plages
         de debarquement a revers.</p>
      
      
      <p>     Mais c'est la une mesure d'un interet defensif, qui ne fera pas
         faire un pas en avant. Il est permis d'autre part de penser que les
         canons des monitors anglais, qui sont sans doute destines a
         detruire les defenses du detroit, commenceront par nous debarrasser
         des batteries de l'entree. Enfin nous disposerons d'ici peu d'un
         front de mer Seddul-Bahr Eski Hissarlick, dont les pieces
         puissantes contrebattront efficacement les canons d'Asie.</p>
      
      
      <p>     Secundo, vers Gaba-Tepe.</p>
      
      
      <p>     Au Sud de <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span> s'etend une plaine que les cartes disent
         accessible au debarquement. Des troupes debarquees la se trouvent a
         8 kilometres environ de Maidos, c'est a dire au point ou la
         presqu'ile est la plus etroite.</p>
      
      
      <p>     Sans nul doute, trouveront elles devant elles les memes difficultes
         qu'ici et il sera necessaire notemment de se rendre maitre des
         montagnes qui dominent la plaine au Nord. Mais alors que la prise
         d'Achi Baba ne sera qu'un grand succes militaire, qui nous mettra
         le lendemain devant les escarpements de Kilid-Bahr, l'occupation de
         la region <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span>-Maidos nous placerait au dela des detroits,
         nous permettrait d'y constituer une base ou les sous-marins de la
         mer de Marmara pourraient indefiniment s'approvisionner.</p>
      
      
      <p>     Si le barrage des <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> n'etait pas brise, il serait tourne.</p>
      
      
      <p>     Tertio, vers Boulair.</p>
      
      
      <p>     Cette solution apparait comme le plus radicale, celui qui
         dejouerait le plan de l'ennemi. <span class="location">Constantinople</span> serait directement
         menace par ce coup retentissant.</p>
      
      
      <p>     Toute la question est de savoir si, avec leurs moyens nouveaux, les
         monitors, les Amiraux sont en mesure de proteger un debarquement,
         qui comme celui du 25 avril necessiterait de nombreux bateaux.</p>
      
      
      <p>     En resume, j'ai l'honneur d'emettre l'avis de poser nettement aux
         Amiraux la question du debarquement a Boulair, d'y faire
         reconnaitre l'etat actuel des defenses par bateaux, avions et si
         possible agents, sans faire d'acte de guerre pour ne pas donner
         l'eveil.</p>
      
      
      <p>     Au cas ou le debarquement serait juge impossible, j'emet l'avis
         d'employer les renforts dans la region Gaba-Tepe, ou les
         Australiens ont deja implante un solide jalon.</p>
      
      
      <p>     Concurremment, je pense qu'il serait du plus vif interet pour hater
         la decision, de creer au Gouvernement Turc des inquietudes dans
         d'autres parties de l'Empire, pour l'empecher d'amener ici toutes
         ses forces.</p>
      
      
      <p>     Dans cet ordre d'idees on peut envisager deux moyens. L'un, le plus
         efficace, est l'action russe ou bulgare. La Grece est mal placee
         geographiquement pour exercer une action sur la guerre. Seule la
         Bulgarie, par sa position geographique, prend les Turcs a revers.
         Sans doute, a voir la facon dont les Turcs amenent devant nous les
         troupes et les canons d'<span class="location">Adrianople</span>, ont ils un accord avec la
         Bulgarie, mais la guerre des Balkans prouve que la Bulgarie n'est
         pas embarrassee d'un accord si elle voit ailleurs son interet. La
         question est donc d'offrir un prix fort a la Bulgarie.</p>
      
      
      <p>     L'autre est de provoquer des agitations dans differentes parties de
         l'Empire, d'y faire operer des destructions par des bandes,
         d'obliger les Turcs a y envoyer du monde. Cela encore vaut la peine
         d'y mettre le prix.</p>
      
      
      <p>     Je suis, avec un profond respect, mon General,</p>
      
      
      <p>                                 Votre tres devoue,
         (Sd.)<span class="person"> GOURAUD</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Boarded a destroyer at 11.15 a.m. and sailed straight for Gully Beach.
         Then into dinghy and paddled to shore where I lunched with <span class="person">de Lisle</span> at
         the <span class="unit">29th Division</span>al Headquarters. Hunter-Weston had come up to meet me
         from Corps Headquarters.</p>
      
      
      <p>With both Generals I rode a couple of miles up the Gully seeing the <span class="unit">87th Brigade</span> as we went. When we got to the mouth of the communication trench
         leading to the front of the Indian Brigade, Bruce of the Gurkhas was
         waiting for us, and led me along through endless sunken ways until we
         reached his firing line.</p>
      
      
      <p>Every hundred yards or so I had a close peep at the ground in front
         through <span class="person">de Lisle's</span> periscope. The enemy trenches were sometimes not more
         than 7 yards away and the rifles of the Turks moving showed there was a
         man behind the loophole. Many corpses, almost all Turks, lay between the
         two lines of trenches. There was no shelling at the moment, but rifle
         bullets kept flopping into the parapet especially when the periscope was
         moved.</p>
      
      
      <p>At the end of the Gurkha line I was met by Colonel Wolley Dod, who took
         me round the fire trenches of the <span class="unit">86th Brigade</span>. The Dublin Fusiliers
         looked particularly fit and jolly.</p>
      
      
      <p>Getting back to the head of the Gully I rode with Hunter-Weston to his
         Corps Headquarters where I had tea before sailing.</p>
      
      
      <p>When I got to <span class="location">Imbros</span> the Fleet were firing at a Taube. She was only
         having a look; flying around the shipping and Headquarters camp at a
         great height, but dropping no bombs. After a bit she scooted off to the
         South-east. Cox dined.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>15th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. Yesterday I learned some detail about the
         conduct of affairs the other day--enough to make me very anxious indeed
         that no tired or nervy leaders should be sent out with the new troops.
         So I have sent <span class="person">K.</span> a cable!--</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F. 334). From General Sir  <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span> to  <span class="person">Earl Kitchener</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>"With reference to the last paragraph of your telegram No. 5250, cipher,
         and my No. M.F. 313. I should like to submit for your consideration the
         following views of the qualities necessary in an Army Corps Commander on
         the <span class="location">Gallipoli Peninsula</span>. In that position only men of good stiff
         constitution and nerve will be able to do any good. Everything is at
         such close quarters that many men would be useless in the somewhat
         exposed headquarters they would have to occupy on this limited terrain,
         though they would do quite good work if moderately comfortable and away
         from constant shell fire. I can think of two men, Byng and Rawlinson.
         Both possess the requisite qualities and seniority; the latter does not
         seem very happy where he is, and the former would have more scope than a
         cavalry Corps can give him in <span class="location">France</span>."</p>
      
      
      <p>Left camp the moment I got this weight off my chest; boarded the
         Savage, or rather jumped on her ladder like a chamois and scrambled on
         deck like a monkey. It was blowing big guns and our launch was very
         nearly swamped. Crossing to <span class="location">Helles</span> big seas were making a clean sweep of
         the decks. Jolly to look at from the bridge.</p>
      
      
      <p>After a dusty walk round piers and beaches lunched with Hunter-Weston
         before inspecting the <span class="unit">155th and 156th Brigades</span>. On our road we were met
         by Brigadier-Generals Erskine and Scott-Moncrieff. Walked the trenches
         where I chatted with the regimental officers and men, and found my
         compatriots in very good form.</p>
      
      
      <p>Went on to the Royal Naval Division Headquarters where Paris met me.
         Together we went round the <span class="unit">3rd Marine Brigade</span> Section under
         Brigadier-General Trotman. These old comrades of the first landing gave
         me the kindliest greetings.</p>
      
      
      <p>Got back to 8th Corps Headquarters intending to enjoy a cup of tea unital
         fresco, but we were reckoning without our host (the Turkish one) who
         threw so many big shell from Asia all about the mound that, (only to
         save the tea cups), we retired with dignified slowness into our dugouts.
         Whilst sitting in these funk-holes, as we used to call them at
         Ladysmith, General<span class="person"> Gouraud</span> ran the gauntlet and made also a slow and
         dignified entry. He was coming back with me to <span class="location">Imbros</span>. As it was getting
         late we hardened our hearts to walk across the open country between
         Headquarters and the beach, where every twenty seconds or so a big
         fellow was raising Cain. Fortune favouring we both reached the sea with
         our heads upon our shoulders.</p>
      
      
      <p>An answer is in to our plea for a Western scale of ammunition, guns and
         howitzers. They cable sympathetically but say simply they can't. Soft
         answers, etc., but it would be well if they could make up their minds
         whether they wish to score the next trick in the East or in the West. If
         they can't do that they will be doubly done.</p>
      
      
      <p>A purely passive defence is not possible for us; it implies losing
         ground by degrees--and we have not a yard to lose. If we are to remain
         we must keep on attacking here and there to maintain ourselves! But; to
         expect us to attack without giving us our fair share--on Western
         standards--of high explosive and howitzers shows lack of military
         imagination. A man's a man for a' that whether at <span class="location">Helles</span> or Ypres. Let
         me bring my lads face to face with Turks in the open field, we must
         beat them every time because British volunteer soldiers are superior
         individuals to Anatolians, Syrians or Arabs and are animated with a
         superior ideal and an equal joy in battle. Wire and machine guns prevent
         this hand to hand, or rifle to rifle, style of contest. Well, then the
         decent thing to do is to give us shells enough to clear a fair field.
         To attempt to solve the problem by letting a single dirty Turk at the
         Maxim kill ten--twenty--fifty--of our fellows on the barbed
         wire,--ten--twenty--fifty--each of whom is worth several dozen Turksunit,
         is a sin of the Holy Ghost category unless it can be justified by dire
         necessity. But there is no necessity. The supreme command has only to
         decide categorically that the Allies stand on the defensive on the West
         for a few weeks and then Von Donop can find us enough to bring us
         through. <span class="person">Joffre</span> and <span class="person">French</span>, as a matter of fact, would hardly feel the
         difference. If the supreme command can't do that; and can't even send us
         trench mortars as substitutes, let them harden their hearts and wind up
         this great enterprise for which they simply haven't got the nerve.</p>
      
      
      <p>If only <span class="person">K.</span> would come and see for himself! Failing that--if only it were
         possible for me to run home and put my own case.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>16th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.<span class="person"> Gouraud</span>, a sympathetic guest, left for French
         Headquarters in one of our destroyers at 3.30 p.m. He is a real Sahib; a
         tower of strength. The Asiatic guns have upset his men a good deal. He
         hopes soon to clap on an extinguisher to their fire by planting down two
         fine big fellows of his own Morto Bay way: we mean to add a couple of
         old naval six-inchers to this battery. During his stay we have very
         thoroughly threshed out our hopes and fears and went into the plan which
         Gouraud thinks offers chances of a record-breaking victory. If the
         character of the new Commanders and the spirit of their troops are of
         the calibre of those on his left flank at <span class="location">Helles</span> he feels pretty
         confident.</p>
      
      
      <p>Talking of Commanders, my appeal for a young Corps Commander of a "good
         stiff constitution" has drawn a startling reply:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. 5501, cipher). From  <span class="person">Earl Kitchener</span> to Sir  <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span>. Your No.
         M.F. 334. I am afraid that <span class="person">Sir John French</span> would not spare the services
         of the two Generals you mention, and they are, moreover, both junior to
         Mahon, who commands the <span class="unit">10th Division</span> which is going out to you. Ewart,
         who is very fit and well, would I think do. I am going to see him the
         day after to-morrow.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">"Mahon</span> raised the <span class="unit">10th Division</span> and has produced an excellent unit. He
         is quite fit and well, and I do not think that he could now be left
         behind."</p>
      
      
      <p>So the field of selection for the new Corps is to be restricted to some
         Lieutenant-General senior to Mahon--himself the only man of his rank
         commanding a Division and almost at the top of the Lieutenant-Generals!
         Oh God, if I could have a Corps Commander like<span class="person"> Gouraud</span>! But this block
         by <span class="person">"Mahon"</span> makes a record for the seniority fetish. I have just been
         studying the Army List with  <span class="person">Pollen</span>. Excluding Indians, Marines and
         employed men like <span class="person">Douglas</span> Haig and <span class="person">Maxwell</span>, there unitare only about one
         dozen British service Lieutenant-Generals senior to Mahon, and, of that
         dozen only two are unitpossible--Ewart and Stopford! There unitare no
         others. Ewart is a fine fellow, with a character which commands respect
         and affection. He is also a Cameron Highlander whose father commanded
         the Gordons. As a presence nothing could be better; as a man no one in
         the Army would be more welcome. But he would not, with his build and
         constitutional habit, last out here for one fortnight. Despite his
         soldier heart and his wise brain we can't risk it. We are unanimous on
         that point. Stopford remains. I have cabled expressing my deep
         disappointment that Mahon should be the factor which restricts all
         choice and saying,</p>
      
      
      <p>"However, my No. M.F. 334[20] gave you what I considered to be the
         qualities necessary in a Commander, so I will do my best with what you
         send me.</p>
      
      
      <p>"With regard to Ewart. I greatly admire his character, but he positively
         could not have made his way along the fire trenches I inspected
         yesterday. He has never approached troops for fifteen years although I
         have often implored him, as a friend, to do so. Would not Stopford be
         preferable to Ewart, even though he does not possess the latter's calm?"</p>
      
      
      <p>I begin to think I shall be recalled for my importunity. But, in for a
         penny in for a pound, and I have fired off the following protest to a
         really disastrous cable from the War Office saying that the New Army is
         to bring unitno 4.5-inch howitzers with it; no howitzers at all, indeed,
         except sixteen of the old, inaccurate 5-inch Territorial howitzers, some
         of which "came out" at Omdurman and were afterwards--the whole
         category--found so much fault with in  Africa. Unless they are
         going to have an August push in <span class="location">France</span> they might at least have lent us
         forty-eight 4.5 hows. from <span class="location">France</span> to see the New Army through their
         first encounter with the enemy. They could all be run back in a fast
         cruiser and would only be loaned to us for three weeks or a month. If
         the G.S. at Whitehall can't do those things, they have handed over the
         running of a world war to one section of the Army. I attach my
         ultimatum: I cannot make it more emphatic; instead of death or victory
         we moderns say howitzers or defeat:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. 5489, cipher, M.G.O.) From War Office to General Officer
         Commanding-in-Chief, Mediterranean Expeditionary Force. Your No. M.F.
         316. It is impossible to send more ammunition than we are sending you.
         528 rounds per 18-pr will be brought out by each Division. Instead of
         4.5-inch howitzers we are sending 16 5-inch howitzers with the <span class="unit">13th Division</span>, as there is more 5-inch ammunition available. By the time that
         the last of the three Divisions arrive we hope to have supplied a good
         percentage of high explosive shells, but you should try to save as much
         as you can in the meantime. Until more ammunition is available for them,
         we cannot send you any 4.5-inch howitzers with the other two Divisions,
         and even if more 5-inch were sent the fortnightly supply of ammunition
         for them would be very small."</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F. 337). From General Sir  <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span> to War Office. With
         reference to your No. 5489, cipher. I am very sorry that you cannot
         send the proper howitzers, and still more sorry for the reason, that of
         ammunition. The Turkish trenches are deep and narrow, and only effective
         weapon for dealing with them is the howitzer. I realize your
         difficulties, and I am sure that you will supply me with both howitzers
         and ammunition as soon as you are able to do so. I shall be glad in the
         meantime of as many more trench mortars and bombs as you can possibly
         spare. We realize for our part that in the matter of guns and ammunition
         it is no good crying for the moon, and for your part you must recognize
         that until howitzers and ammunition arrive it is no good crying for the
         Crescent."</p>
      
      
      <p>The Admiral and Godley paid me a visit; discussed tea and sea transport,
         then a walk.</p>

      <p>17th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. Smoother sea, but rough weather in office. A
         cable from the Master General of the Ordnance in reply to my petition
         for another battery of 6-inch howitzers:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. 5537, cipher, M.G.O.) From War Office to the General Officer

         No. M.F. 331. We can send out another battery of 6-inch howitzers, but
         cannot send ammunition with it. Moreover, we cannot increase the present
         periodical supply, so that if we send the additional howitzers you must
         not complain of the small number of rounds per gun sent to you, as
         experience has shown is sometimes done in similar cases. It is possible
         that the Navy may help you with 6-inch ammunition. Please say after
         consideration of the above if you want the howitzers sent."</p>
      
      
      <p>My mind plays agreeably with the idea of chaining the M.G.O. on to a
         rock on the Peninsula whilst the Asiatic batteries are pounding it. That
         would learn him to be an M.G.O.; singing us Departmental ditties whilst
         we are trying to hold our Asiatic wolf by the ears. I feel very
         depressed; we are too far away; so far away that we lie beyond the
         grasp of an M.G.O.'s imagination. That's the whole truth. Were the
         Army in <span class="location">France</span> to receive such a message, within 24 hours the
         Commander-in-Chief, or at the least his Chief of the Staff, would walk
         into the M.G.O.'s office and then proceed to walk into the M.G.O. I
         can't do that; a bad tempered cable is useless; I have no weapon at my
         disposal but very mild sarcasm:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F. 343). From General Sir  <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span> to War Office. Your No.
         5537, cipher, M.G.O. Please send the battery of 6-inch howitzers. Your
         admonition will be borne in mind. Extra howitzers will be most useful to
         replace pieces damaged by enemy batteries on the Asiatic side of the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>. No doubt in time the ammunition question will improve. Only
         yesterday prisoners reported that 14 more Turkish heavy guns were coming
         to the Peninsula."</p>
      
      
      <p>Have written another screed to <span class="person">French</span>. As it gives a sort of summing up
         of the state of affairs to-day I spatchcock (as Buller used to say) the
         carbon:--</p>
      
      
      <p>         "GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,
         "MEDITERRANEAN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE,
         17th June, 1915.</p>
      
      
      <p>  "MY DEAR <span class="person">FRENCH</span>,</p>
      
      
      <p>"It must be fully a month since I wrote you but no one understands
         better than you must do, how time flies under the constant strain of
         these night and day excursions and alarms. Between the two letters there
         has been a desperate lot of fighting, mostly bomb and bayonet work, and,
         except for a good many Turks gone to glory, there is only a few hundred
         yards of ground to show for it all at Anzac, and about a mile perhaps in
         the southern part of the Peninsula. But taking a wider point of view, I
         hope our losses and efforts have gained a good deal for our cause
         although they may not be so measurable in yards. First, the Turks are
         defending themselves instead of attacking <span class="location">Egypt</span> and over-running Basra;
         secondly, we are told on high authority, that the action of the Italians
         in coming in was precipitated by our entry into this part of the
         theatre; thirdly, if we can only hold on and continue to enfeeble the
         Turks, I think myself it will not be very long before some of the Balkan
         States take the bloody plunge.</p>
      
      
      <p>"However all that may be, we must be prepared at the worst to win
         through by ourselves, and it is, I assure you, a tough proposition. In
         a manoeuvre battle of old style our fellows here would beat twice
         their number of Turks in less than no time, but, actually, the
         restricted Peninsula suits the Turkish tactics to a 'T.' They have
         always been good at trench work where their stupid men have only simple,
         straightforward duties to perform, namely, in sticking on and shooting
         anything that comes up to them. They do this to perfection; I never saw
         braver soldiers, in fact, than some of the best of them. When we
         advance, no matter the shelling we give them, they stand right up firing
         coolly and straight over their parapets. Also they have unlimited
         supplies of bombs, each soldier carrying them, and they are not half bad
         at throwing them. Meanwhile they are piling up a lot of heavy artillery
         of very long range on the Asiatic shore, and shell us like the devil
         with 4.5, 6-inch, 8, 9.2 and 10-inch guns--not pleasant. This
         necessitates a very tough type of man for senior billets. X--Y--, for
         instance, did not last 24 hours. Everyone here is under fire, and really
         and truly the front trenches are safer, or at least fully as safe, as
         the Corps Commander's dugout. For, if the former are nearer the
         <span class="unit">Infantry</span>, the latter is nearer the big guns firing into our rear.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Another reason why we advance so slowly and lose so much is that the
         enemy get constant reinforcements. We have overcome three successive
         armies of Turks, and a new lot of 20,000 from Syria are arriving here
         now, with 14 more heavy guns, so prisoners say, but I hope not.</p>
      
      
      <p>"I have fine Corps Commanders in <span class="person">Birdwood</span>, Hunter-Weston and<span class="person"> Gouraud</span>.
         This is very fortunate. Who is to be Commander of the new corps I cannot
         say, but we have one or two terrifying suggestions from home.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Last night a brisk attack headed by a senior Turkish Officer and a
         German Officer was made on the <span class="unit">86th Brigade</span>. Both these Officers were
         killed and 20 or 30 of their men, the attack being repulsed. Against the
         South Wales Borderers a much heavier attack was launched. Our fellows
         were bombed clean out of their trenches, but only fell back 30 yards and
         dug in. This morning early we got maxims on to each end of the place
         they had stormed, and then the Dublins retook it with the bayonet. Two
         hundred of their dead were left in the trench, and we only had 50
         casualties--not so bad! A little later on in the day a d----d submarine
         appeared and had some shots at our transports and store ships. Luckily
         she missed, but all our landing operations of supplies were suspended.
         These are the sort of daily anxieties. All one can do is to carry on
         with determination and trust in providence.</p>
      
      
      <p>"I hope you are feeling fit and that things are going on well generally.
         Give my salaams to the great Robertson, also to Barry. Otherwise please
         treat this letter as private. With all kind remembrance.</p>

      <p>CHAPTER XI BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         Our beautiful East Lancs. Division is in a very bad way. One more month
         of neglect and it will be ruined: if quickly filled up with fresh drafts
         it will be better than ever. Have cabled:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"(M.F.A. 871). From General Sir  <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span> to War Office. The
         following is the shortage of officers and rank and file in each Brigade
         of the XLIInd <span class="unit">East Lancashire Division</span> including the reinforcements
         reported as arriving:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  <span class="unit">125th Brigade</span>    50 Officers, 1,852 rank and file.
         <span class="unit">126th Brigade</span>    31 Officers, 1,714 rank and file.
         <span class="unit">127th Brigade</span>    50 Officers, 2,297 rank and file.</p>
      
      
      <p>"A stage of wastage has now been reached in this Division, especially in
         the <span class="unit">127th Manchester Brigade</span>, when filling up with drafts will make it
         as good or better than ever. If, however, they have to go on fighting in
         their present condition and suffer further losses, the remnants will not
         offer sufficiently wide foundation for reconstituting cadres.</p>
      
      
      <p>"<span class="person">Lord Kitchener</span> might also like to know this, that a satisfactory
         proportion of the officers recently sent out to fill casualties are
         shaping very well indeed."</p>
      
      
      <p>An amalgam of veterans and fresh keen recruits, cemented by a common
         county feeling as well as by war tradition, makes the best fighting
         formation in the world. The veterans give experience and
         steadiness;--when the battle is joined the old hands feel bound to make
         good their camp-fire boastings to the recruits. The recruits bring
         freshness and the spirit of competition;--they are determined to show
         that they are as brave as the old fighters. But, if the East Lancs. go
         on dwindling, the cadre will not retain strength enough to absorb and
         shape the recruits who will, we must suppose, some day be poured into
         it. A perishing formation loses moral force in more rapid progression
         than the mere loss of members would seem to warrant. When a <span class="unit">battalion</span>
         which entered upon a campaign a thousand strong,--all keen and
         hopeful,--gets down to five hundred, comrades begin to look round at one
         another and wonder if any will be left. When it falls to three hundred,
         or less, the unit, in my experience, is better drawn out of the line.
         The bravest men lose heart when, on parade, they see with their own eyes
         that their Company--the finest Company in the Army--has become a
         platoon,--and the famous <span class="unit">battalion</span> a Company. A mould for shaping young
         enthusiasms into heroisms has been scrapped and it takes a desperate
         long time to recreate it.</p>
      
      
      <p>I want to be sure <span class="person">K.</span> himself takes notice and that is why I refer to him
         at the tail end of the cable. We have also cabled saying that the idea
         of sending so many rounds per gun per day was excellent, but that "we
         have received no notice of any despatch later than the <span class="location">S.S. Arabian</span>,
         which consignment" (whenever it might arrive?) "was only due to last
         until the day before yesterday"! So this is what our famous agreement to
         have munitions on the scale deemed necessary by <span class="person">Joffre</span> and French pans
         out at in practice. Two-fifths of their amount and that not delivered!</p>
      
      
      <p>Dined with the Admiral on board the Triad. A glorious dinner. The
         sailormen have a real pull over us soldiers in all matters of messing.
         Linen, plate, glass, bread, meat, wine; of the best, are on the spot,
         always: even after the enemy is sighted, if they happen to feel a sense
         of emptiness they have only to go to the cold sideboard.</p>
      
      
      <p>Coming back found mess tent brilliantly lit up and my staff entertaining
         their friends. So I put on my life-saving waistcoat and blew it out;
         clapped my new gas-mask on my head and entered. They were really
         startled, thinking the devil had come for them before their time.</p>
      
      
      <p>Just got a telegram saying that M. Venezelos has gained a big majority
         in the Greek Election. Also, that the King of Greece is dying, and that,
         therefore, the Greek Army can't join us until he has come round or gone
         under.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>18th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. Went over to Kephalos Camp to inspect
         Rochdale's 127th (Manchester) Brigade. The Howe <span class="unit">Battalion</span> of the 2nd
         Naval Brigade were there (Lieutenant-Colonel Collins), also, the 3rd
         Field Ambulance R.N.D. All these were enjoying an easy out of the
         trenches and, though only at about half strength, had already quite
         forgotten the tragic struggles they had passed through. In fattest peace
         times, I never saw a keener, happier looking lot. I drew courage from
         the ranks. Surely these are the faces of men turned to victory!</p>
      
      
      <p>Some twenty unattached officers fresh from <span class="location">England</span> were there: a likely
         looking lot. One of the brightest a Socialist M.P.</p>
      
      
      <p>The inspection took me all forenoon so I had to sweat double shifts
         after lunch. Hunter-Weston came over from <span class="location">Helles</span> at 7.15 p.m. and we
         dined off crayfish. He was in great form.</p>
      
      
      <p>The War Office can get no more bombs for our Japanese trench mortars! A
         catastrophe this! Putting the French on one side, we here, in this great
         force, possess only half a dozen good trench mortars--the Japanese.
         These six are worth their weight in gold to Anzac. Often those fellows
         have said to me that if they had twenty-five of them, with lots of
         bombs, they could render the Turkish trenches untenable. Twice, whilst
         their six precious mortars have been firing, I have stood for half an
         hour with <span class="person">Birdie</span>, watching and drinking in encouragement. About one bomb
         a minute was the rate of fire and as it buzzed over our own trenches
         like a monstrous humming bird all the naked Anzacs laughed. Then, unitsuchunit
         an explosion and a sort of long drawn out ei-ei-ei-ei cry of horror from
         the Turks. It was fine,--a real corpse-reviving performance and now the
         W.O. have let the stock run out, because some ass has forgotten to order
         them in advance. Have cabled a very elementary question: "Could not the
         Japanese bombs be copied in <span class="location">England</span>?"</p>
      
      
      <p>Being the Centenary of Waterloo, the thoughts and converse of
         Hunter-Weston and myself turned naturally towards the lives of the
         heroes of a hundred years ago whose monument had given us our education,
         and from that topic, equally naturally, to the boys of the coming
         generation. Then wrote out greetings to be sent by wire on my own behalf
         and on behalf of all Wellingtonians serving under my command here: this
         to the accompaniment of unusually heavy shell fire on the Peninsula.</p>
      
      
      <p>Later.--Have just heard that after a heavy bombardment the Turks made
         an attack and that fighting is going on now.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>19th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. The Turks expended last night some 500 H.E.
         shells; 250 heavy stuff from Asia and some thousands of shrapnel. They
         then attacked; we counter-attacked and there was some confused
         in-and-out <span class="unit">Infantry</span> fighting. We hear that the South Wales Borderers,
         the Worcesters, the 5th Royal Scots and the Naval Division all won
         distinction. Wiring home I say, "If <span class="person">Lord Kitchener</span> could tell the Lord
         Provost of Edinburgh how well the 5th Bn. Royal Scots have done, the
         whole of this force would be pleased." The Turks have left 1,000 dead
         behind them. Prisoners say they thought so much high explosive would
         knock a hole in our line: the bombardment was all concentrated on the
         South Wales Borderers' trench.</p>
      
      
      <p>Writing most of the day. Lord <span class="person">K.</span> has asked the French Government to send
         out extra quantities of H.E. shell to their force here; also, he has
         begged them to order<span class="person"> Gouraud</span> to lend me his guns. In so far as the
         French may get more H.E. this is A.1. But if <span class="person">K.</span> thinks the British will
         unitdirectlyunit benefit--I fear he is out of his reckoning: it would be fatal
         to my relations with<span class="person"> Gouraud</span>, now so happy, were he even to suspect that
         I had any sort of lien on his guns. Unless I want to stir up jealous
         feelings, now entirely quiescent, I cannot use this cable as a lever to
         get French guns across into our area.<span class="person"> Gouraud</span>'s plans for his big attack
         are now quite complete. A million pities we cannot attack
         simultaneously. That we should attack one week and the French another
         week is rotten tactically; but, practically, we have no option. We
         British want to go in side by side with the French--are burning to do
         so--but we cannot think of it until we can borrow shell from<span class="person"> Gouraud</span>;
         and, naturally, he wants every round he has for his own great push on
         the 21st. Walked down in the evening to see what progress was being made
         with the new pier. Colonel Skeen, <span class="person">Birdwood</span>'s Chief of Staff, dined and
         seems clever, as well as a very pleasant fellow.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>20th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. Rose early. Did a lot of business. The King's
         Messenger's bag closed at 8 a.m. Told <span class="person">K.</span> about the arrival of fresh
         Turkish troops and our fighting on the 18th. The trenches remain as
         before, but the Turks, having failed, are worse off.</p>
      
      
      <p>I have also written him about war correspondents. He had doubted whether
         my experiences would encourage me to increase the number to two or
         three. But, after trial, I prefer that the public should have a
         multitude of councillors. "When a single individual," I say, "has the
         whole of the London Press at his back he becomes an unduly important
         personage. When, in addition to this, it so happens, that he is inclined
         to see the black side of every proposition, then it becomes difficult to
         prevent him from encouraging the enemy, and from discouraging all our
         own people, as well as the Balkan States. If I have several others to
         counterbalance, then I do not care so much."</p>
      
      
      <p>Fired off a second barrel through Fitz from whom I have just heard that
         my Despatch cannot be published as it stands but must be bowdlerized
         first, all the names of <span class="unit">battalions</span> being cut out. Instead of saying,
         "The landing at 'W' had been entrusted to the 1st Bn. Lancashire
         Fusiliers (Major Bishop) and it was to the complete lack of the sense of
         danger or of fear of this daring <span class="unit">battalion</span> that we owed our astonishing
         success," I am to say, "The landing, etc., had been entrusted to a
         certain <span class="unit">battalion</span>."</p>
      
      
      <p>The whole of this press correspondence; press censorship; despatch
         writing and operations cables hang together and will end by hanging the
         Government.</p>
      
      
      <p>My operations cables are written primarily for <span class="person">K.</span>, it is true, but they
         are meant also to let our own people know what their brothers and sons
         are up against and how they are bearing up under unheard of trials.
         There is not a word in those cables which would help or encourage the
         enemy. I am best judge of that and I see to it myself.</p>
      
      
      <p>What is the result of my efforts to throw light upon our proceedings? A
         War Office extinguisher from under which only a few evil-smelling
         phrases escape. As I say to Fitz:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"You seem to see nothing beyond the mischief that may happen if the
         enemy gets to know too much about us; you do not see that this danger
         can be kept within bounds and is of small consequence when compared with
         the keenness or dullness of our own Nation."</p>
      
      
      <p>The news that the War Office were going to send us no more Japanese
         bombs spread so great a consternation at Anzac that I have followed up
         my first remonstrance with a second and a stronger cable:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F. 348). From General Sir  <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span> to War Office. Your No.
         5272, A.2.[21] I particularly request that you may reconsider your
         proposal not to order more Japanese bombs. These bombs are most
         effective and in high favour with our troops whose locally-made weapons,
         on which they have frequently to rely, are far inferior to the bombs
         used by the Turks. Our great difficulty in holding captured trenches is
         that the Turks always counter-attack with a large number of powerful
         bombs. Apparently their supply of these is limitless. Unless the delay
         in arrival is likely to extend over several months, therefore, I would
         suggest that a large order be sent to <span class="location">Japan</span>. We cannot have too many of
         these weapons, and this should not cancel my No. M.F.Q.T. 1321, which
         should be treated as additional."</p>
      
      
      <p>Drafted also a long cable discussing a diversion on the Asiatic shore of
         the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>. So some work had been done by the time we left camp at
         9.15 a.m., and got on board the Triad. After a jolly sail reached
         <span class="person">Mudros</span> at 2 p.m., landing on the Australian pier at 3 p.m. <span class="person">Mudros</span> is a
         dusty hole; ein trauriges Nest, as our German friends would say.</p>
      
      
      <p>Worked like a nigger going right through Nos. 15 and 16 Stationary
         Hospitals. Colonel Maher, P.M.O., came round, also Colonel Jones,
         R.A.M.C., and Captain Stanley, R.A.M.C. Talked with hundreds of men:
         these are the true philosophers.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>21st June, 1915. <span class="person">Mudros</span>. Went at it again and overhauled No. 2
         Stationary Hospital under Lieutenant-Colonel White, as well as No. 1
         Stationary Hospital commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Bryant. The doctors
         praised me for inventing something new to say to each man. But all the
         time in my mind was the thought of<span class="person"> Gouraud</span>. I have wanted him to do it
         absolutely on his own, and I could not emphasize this better than by
         coming right away to <span class="person">Mudros</span>. Back to the Triad by 1 p.m. No news.
         Weighed anchor at once, steaming for <span class="location">Imbros</span>, where we cast anchor at
         about 6 p.m. <span class="person">Freddie Maitland</span> has arrived here, like a breath of air
         from home, to be once more my A.D.C.; his features wreathed in the
         well-known, friendly smile. The French duly attacked at dawn and the <span class="unit">2nd Division</span> have carried a series of redoubts and trenches.
         The <span class="unit">1st Division</span> did equally well but have been driven back again by
         counter-attacks. Fighting is still going on.</p>
      
      
      <p>While I have been away <span class="person"> Braithwaite</span> has cabled home in my name asking
         which of the new Divisions is the best, as we shall have to use them
         before we can get to know them.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>22nd June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. An anxious night.<span class="person"> Gouraud</span> has done
         splendidly; so have his troops. This has been a serious defeat for the
         Turks; a real bad defeat, showing, as it does, that given a modicum of
         ammunition we can seize the strongest entrenchments of the enemy and
         stick to them.</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F. 357). From General Sir  <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span> to Secretary of State for
         War. After 24 hours' heavy and continuous fighting a substantial
         success has been achieved. As already reported, the battle of 4th-5th
         June resulted in a good advance of my centre to which neither my right
         nor my left were able to conform, the reason being that the Turkish
         positions in front of the flanks are naturally strong and exceedingly
         well fortified. At 4.30 a.m. yesterday, General<span class="person"> Gouraud</span> began an attack
         upon the line of formidable works which run along the Kereves Dere. By
         noon the second French Division had stormed and captured all the Turkish
         first and second line trenches opposite their front, including the
         famous Haricot Redoubt, with its subsidiary maze of entanglements and
         communication trenches. On their right, the first French Division, after
         fierce fighting, also took the Turkish trenches opposite their front,
         but were counter-attacked so heavily that they were forced to fall back.
         Again, this Division attacked, again it stormed the position, and again
         it was driven out. General<span class="person"> Gouraud</span> then, at 2.55 p.m., issued the
         following order:"</p>
      
      
      <p>'From Colonel Viont's report it is evident that the preparation for the
         attack at 2.15 p.m. was not sufficient.</p>
      
      
      <p>'It is indispensable that the Turkish first line of trenches in front of
         you should be taken, otherwise the gains of the<span class="unit">2nd Division</span> may be
         rendered useless. You have five hours of daylight, take your time, let
         me know your orders and time fixed for preparation, and arrange for
         <span class="unit">Infantry</span> assault to be simultaneous after preparation.'</p>
      
      
      <p>"As a result of this order, the bombardment of the Turkish left was
         resumed, the British guns and howitzers lending their aid to the French
         Artillery as in the previous attacks. At about 6 p.m., a fine attack was
         launched, 600 yards of Turkish first line trenches were taken, and
         despite heavy counter-attacks during the night, especially at 3.20 a.m.,
         all captured positions are still in our hands. Am afraid casualties are
         considerable, but details are lacking. The enemy lost very heavily. One
         Turkish <span class="unit">battalion</span> coming up to reinforce, was spotted by an aeroplane,
         and was practically wiped out by the seventy-fives before they could
         scatter.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Type of fighting did not lend itself to taking prisoners, and only some
         50, including one officer, are in our hands. The elan and contempt of
         danger shown by the young French drafts of the last contingent,
         averaging, perhaps, 20 years of age, was much admired by all. During the
         fighting, the French battleship <span class="location">St. Louis</span> did excellent service
         against the Asiatic batteries. All here especially regret that Colonel
         <span class="person">Girodon</span>, one of the best staff officers existing, has been severely
         wounded whilst temporarily commanding a brigade. Colonel Nogues, also an
         officer of conspicuous courage, already twice wounded, at Kum Kale, has
         again been badly hit."</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Girodon</span> is one in ten thousand; serious, brave and far sighted. The
         bullet went through his lung. We are said to have suffered nearly 3,000
         casualties.</p>
      
      
      <p>They say that the uproar of battle was tremendous, especially between
         midnight and 4 a.m. Some of our newly arrived troops stood to their arms
         all night thinking the end of the world had come.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 6 p.m. <span class="person">de Robeck</span>, <span class="person">Keyes</span>, <span class="person">Ormsby Johnson</span> and <span class="person">Godfrey</span> came over from
         the flagship to see me.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have got an answer about the Japanese trench mortars and bombs. In two
         months' time a thousand bombs will be ready at the Japanese Arsenal, and
         five hundred the following month. The trench mortars--bomb guns they
         call them--will be ready in <span class="location">Japan</span> in two and a half months' time. Two
         and a half months, plus half a month for delay, plus another month for
         sea transit, makes four months! There are some things speak for
         themselves. Blood, they say, cries out to Heaven. Well, let it cry now.
         Over three months ago I asked--my first request--for these primitive
         engines and as for the bombs, had <span class="location">Birmingham</span> been put to it, <span class="location">Birmingham</span>
         could have turned them out as quick as shelling peas.</p>
      
      
      <p>Am doing what I can to fend for myself. This <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> war is a war,
         if ever there was one, of the ingenuity and improvised efforts of man
         against nature plus machinery. We are in the desert and have to begin
         very often at the beginning of things. The Navy unitnowunit assure me that
         their Dockyard Superintendent at <span class="location">Malta</span> could make us a fine lot of hand
         grenades in his workshops if <span class="person">Lord Methuen</span> will give him the order.</p>
      
      
      <p>So I have directed a full technical specification of the Turkish hand
         grenades being used against us with effects so terrible, to be sent on
         to Methuen telling him it is simple, effective, that I hope he can make
         them and will be glad to take all he can turn out.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>23rd June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. Another day in camp. <span class="person">de Robeck</span> and <span class="person">Keyes</span> came
         over from the Triad to unravel knotty points.</p>
      
      
      <p>Am enraged to recognize in Reuter one of my own cables which has been
         garbled in <span class="location">Egypt</span>. The press censorship is a negative evil in London; in
         Cairo there is no doubt it is positive. After following my wording
         pretty closely, a phrase has been dovetailed in to say that the Turks
         have day and night to submit to the capture of trenches. These cables
         are repeated to London and when they get back here what will my own men
         think me? If, as most of us profess to believe, it is a mistake to tell
         lies, what a specially fatal description of falsehood to issue
         short-dated bulletins of victory with only one month to run. I have
         fired off a remonstrance as follows:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No M.F. 359). From General Sir  <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span> to War Office. A Reuter
         telegram dated London, 16th June, has just been brought to my notice in
         which it is stated that the Press Bureau issues despatch in which the
         following sentence occurs: 'Day and night they (the Turks) have to
         submit to capture of trenches.' This information is incorrect, and as
         far as we are aware, has not been sent from here. This false news puts
         me in a false position with my troops, who know it to be untrue, and I
         should be glad if you would trace whence it emanates.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Repeated to General Officer Commanding, <span class="location">Egypt</span>."</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>24th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. Three days ago we asked the War Office to let
         us know the merits of the three new Divisions. The War Office replied
         placing them in the order XIth; XIIth; Xth, and reminding me that the
         personality of the Commander would be the chief factor for deciding
         which were to be employed in any particular operation. <span class="person">K.</span> now
         supplements this by a cable in which he sizes up the Commanders.
         <span class="person">Hammersley</span> gets a good chit but the phrase, "he will have to be
         watched to see that the strain of trench warfare is not too much for
         him" is ominous. I knew him in October, '99, and thought him a fine
         soldier. Mahon, "without being methodical," is praised. Shaw gets a
         moderate eulogy, but we out here are glad to have him for we know him.
         On these two War Office cables <span class="person">Hammersley</span> and the <span class="unit">11th Division</span> should
         be for it.</p>
      
      
      <p>After clearing my table, embarked with <span class="person"> Braithwaite</span> and Mitchell aboard
         the Basilisk (Lieutenant Fallowfield) and made her stand in as close
         as we dared at <span class="location">Suvla Bay</span> and the coast to the North of it. We have kept
         a destroyer on patrol along that line, and we were careful to follow the
         usual track and time, so as to rouse no suspicions.</p>
      
      
      <p>To spy out the land with a naval telescope over a mile of sea means
         taking a lot on trust as we learned to our cost on April 25th. We can't
         even be sure if the Salt Lake is a lake, or whether the glister we see
         there is just dry sand. We shall have to pretend to do some gun
         practice, and drop a shell on to its surface to find out. No sign of
         life anywhere, not even a trickle of smoke. The whole of the <span class="location">Suvla Bay</span>
         area looks peaceful and deserted. God grant that it may remain so until
         we come along and make it the other thing.</p>
      
      
      <p>On my return the Admiral came to hear what I thought about it all. Our
         plan is bold, but there never was a state of affairs less suited to half
         and half, keep-in-the-middle-of-the-road tactics than that with which
         the Empire is faced to-day. If we get through here, now, the war will,
         must be, over next year. My Manchurian Campaign and two Russian
         Manoeuvres have taught me that, from Grand Duke to Moujiks, our Allies
         need just that precise spice of initiative which we, only we in the
         world, can lend them. Advice, cash, munitions aren't enough; our
         palpable presence is the point. The arrival of <span class="person">Birdwood</span>, <span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span>
         and <span class="person">Gouraud</span> at <span class="location">Odessa</span> would electrify the whole of the Russian Army.</p>
      
      
      <p>As to the plan, I have had the G.S. working hard upon it for over a
         fortnight (ever since the Cabinet decided to support us). Secrecy is so
         ultra-vital that we are bound to keep the thing within a tiny circle. I
         am not the originator. Though I have entirely fathered it, the idea was
         born at Anzac. We have not yet got down to precise dates, units or
         commanders but, in those matters, the two cables already entered this
         morning should help. The plan is based upon <span class="person">Birdwood</span>'s confidence that,
         if only he can be strengthened by another Division, he can seize and
         hold the high crest line which dominates his own left, and in my own
         concurrence in that confidence. Sari Bair is the "keep" to the Narrows;
         Chunuk Bair and <span class="location">Hill 305</span> are its keys: i.e., from those points the
         Turkish trenches opposite <span class="person">Birdwood</span> can be enfiladed: the land and sea
         communications of the enemy holding Maidos, Kilid Bahr and <span class="location"> Krithia </span> can
         be seen and shelled and, in fact, any strong force of Turks guarding the
         European side of the Narrows can then be starved out, whilst a weak
         force will not long resist<span class="person"> Gouraud</span> and Hunter-Weston. As to our tactical
         scheme for producing these strategical results, it is simple in outline
         though infernally complicated in its amphibious and supply aspects. The
         French and British at <span class="location">Helles</span> will attack so as to draw the attention of
         the Turks southwards. To add to this effect, we are thinking of asking
         the Anzacs to exert a preliminary pressure on the <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span> alarum to
         the southwards. We shall then give <span class="person">Birdwood</span> what he wants, an extra
         division, and it will be a problem how to do so without letting the
         enemy smell a rat. <span class="person">Birdwood</span>'s Intelligence are certain that no trenches
         have been dug by the enemy along the high ridge from Chunuk Bair to Hill
         305. He is sure that with one more Division under his direct command,
         plus the help of a push from <span class="location">Helles</span> to ease his southern flank, he can
         make good these dominating heights.</p>
      
      <div class="Chunuk"><img src="images/Chunuk.jpg" alt="ya_4_people" width="535" height= "400"/>
         <p style="text-align:center">[Illustration: THE NARROWS FROM CHUNUK BAIR]</p></div>
      
      
      
      <p>But,--here comes the second half of the plan: the balance of the
         reinforcements from home are also to be thrown into the scale so as at
         the same time to give further support to <span class="person">Birdwood</span> on his northern
         flank and to occupy a good harbour (<span class="location">Suvla Bay</span>) whence we can run a light
         railway line and more effectively feed the troops holding Sari Bair than
         they could be fed from the bad, cramped beaches of Anzac Cove. This will
         be the more necessary as the process of starving out the Turks to the
         south must take time. <span class="location">Suvla Bay</span> should be an easy base to seize as it is
         weakly held and unentrenched whilst, tactically, any troops landed there
         will, by a very short advance, be able to make <span class="person">Birdwood</span>'s mind easy
         about his left. Altogether, the plan seems to me simple in outline, and
         sound in principle. The ground between Anzac and the Sari Bair crestline
         is worse than the Khyber Pass but both <span class="person">Birdwood</span> and Godley say that
         their troops can tackle it. There are one or two in the know who think
         me "venturesome" but, after all, is not "nothing venture nothing win" an
         unanswerable retort?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">de Robeck</span> is excited over some new anti-submarine nets. They are so
         strong and he can run them out so swiftly that they open, he seems to
         think, new possibilities of making landings,--not on open coasts like
         the North of the Aegean but at places like Yukeri Bay, where the nets
         could be spread from the North and South ends of <span class="location">Tenedos</span> to shoals
         connecting with Asia so as to make a torpedo proof basin for transports.
         The Navy, in fact, suddenly seem rather bitten with the idea of landing
         opposite <span class="location">Tenedos</span>. But whereas, this very afternoon, our own eyes
         confirmed the aeroplane reports that <span class="location">Suvla Bay</span> is unentrenched, weakly
         held and quiescent, only yesterday a division of the enemy were reputed
         to be busy along the whole of the coastline to the South of Besika Bay.</p>
      
      
      <p>I have raised a hornet's nest by my objection to faked cables; but I
         will not have it done. They may suppress but they shall not invent.</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F. 366). From General Sir  <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span> to War Office. Your No.
         12431. I do not object to General Officer Commanding, <span class="location">Egypt</span>, publishing
         any telegram I send him, as I write them for that purpose. But I do
         object to the addition of news which is untrue, and which can surely be
         seen through by any reading public. If we can take trenches at our will,
         why are we still on this side of Achi Baba?</p>
      
      
      <p>"In compliance with <span class="person">Lord Kitchener</span>'s instructions I send a telegram to

         10,475, code, and my No. M.F. 285, instructing me to do this. These
         telegrams are practically identical when they leave here, and are

         I find a mutilated and misleading Cairo telegram reproduced in London
         Press in place of the true version I sent to the Secretary of State for
         War."</p>
      
      
      <p>General Paris crossed from <span class="location">Helles</span> to dine and stay the night. After
         dinner, Commodore Backhouse came over to make his salaams to his
         Divisional Chief.</p>
      
      
      <p>Gouraud has sent me his reply to Lord <span class="person">K.</span>'s congratulations on his
         victory of the 21st. He says,</p>
      
      
      <p>     "Vous prie exprimer a <span class="person">Lord Kitchener</span> mes respectueux remerciements
         nous n'avons, eu qu'a prendre exemple sur les heroiques regiments
         anglais qui ont debarque dans les fils de fer sur la plage de
         Seddulbahr."</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>25th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. At 8 a.m. walked down with Paris to see him
         off. Worked till 11 a.m. and then crossed over to "K" Beach where
         Backhouse, commanding the <span class="unit">2nd Naval Brigade</span>, met me. Inspected the Hood,
         Howe and Anson <span class="unit">Battalions</span> into which had been incorporated the
         Collingwood and Benbow units--too weak now to carry on as independent
         units. The Hood, Howe and Anson are suffering from an acute attack of
         indigestion, and Collingwoods and Benbows are sick at having been
         swallowed. But I had to do it seeing there is no word of the cruel
         losses of the battle of the 4th being made good by the Admiralty. The
         Howe, Hood and Anson attacked on our extreme right, next the French.
         They did most gloriously--most gloriously! As to the Collingwoods, they
         were simply cut to pieces, losing 25 officers out of 28 in a few
         minutes. Down at the roots of this unhappiness lie the neglect to give
         us our fair share of howitzers and trench mortars--in fact stupidity!
         The rank and file all round looked much better for their short rest, and
         seemed to like the few halting words of praise I was able to say to
         them. Lunched with Backhouse in a delicious garden under a spreading fig
         tree; then rode back.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 5 p.m. Ashmead-Bartlett had an appointment, <span class="person">K.</span> himself took trouble
         to send me several cables about him a little time ago. Referring in one
         of them to the dangers of letting Jeremiah loose in London, <span class="person">K.</span> said,
         "Ashmead-Bartlett has promised verbally to speak to no one but his
         Editor, who can be trusted." Verbally, or in writing, my astonishment at
         <span class="person">K.</span>'s confidence can only find expression in verse:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  "Oft expectation fails, and most oft there
         Where most it promises;"</p>
      
      
      <p>He, Ashmead-Bartlett, came to-day to beg me to deliver him out of the
         hands of the Censor. He wants certain changes made and I have agreed.</p>
      
      
      <p>Next, he fully explained to me the importance of the Bulair Lines and
         urged me to throw the new Divisions against them. He seems to think he
         is mooting to me a spick and span new idea--that he has invented
         something. Finally, he suggests ten shillings and a free pardon be
         offered to every Turk who deserts to our lines with his rifle and kit:
         he believes we should thus get rid of the whole of the enemy army very
         quickly.</p>
      
      
      <p>This makes one wonder what would Ashmead-Bartlett himself do if he were
         offered ten shillings and a good supper by a Mahommedan when he was
         feeling a bit hungry and hard up amongst the Christians. Anyway, there
         is no type of soldier man fighting in the war who is more faithful to
         his salt than the Osmanli Turk. Were we to offer fifty pounds per head,
         instead of ten shillings, the bid would rebound in shame upon ourselves.</p>
      
      
      <p>Colonel Sir Mark Sykes was my next visitor. He is fulfilling the promise
         of his 'teens when he was the shining light of the Militia; was as keen
         a Galloper as I have had on a list which includes Winston and F.E., and,
         generally, gained much glory, martial, equestrian, histrionic,
         terpsichorean at our Militia Training Camp on Salisbury Plain in '99.
         Now he has mysteriously made himself (heaven knows how) into our premier
         authority on the Middle East and is travelling on some ultra-mysterious
         mission, very likely, en passant, as a critic of our doings: never
         mind, he is thrice welcome as a large-hearted and generous person.</p>
      
      
      <p>Dined with <span class="person">de Robeck</span> on board the Triad. He is most hospitable and
         kind. I have not here the wherewithal to give back cutlet for cutlet,
         worse luck.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>26th June, 1915. Worked till past 11 o'clock, then started
         for Anzac with <span class="person"> Braithwaite</span> per destroyer Pincher (Lieutenant-Commander
         Wyld). After going a short way was shifted to the Mosquito
         (Lieutenant-Commander Clarke). We had biscuits in our pockets, but the
         hospitable Navy stood us lunch.</p>
      
      
      <p>When the Turks saw a destroyer come bustling up at an unusual hour they
         said to themselves, "fee faw fum!" and began to raise pillars of water
         here and there over the surface of the cove. As we got within a few
         yards of the pier a shell hit it, knocking off some splinters. I jumped
         on to it--had to--then jumped off it nippier still and, turning to the
         right, began to walk towards <span class="person">Birdie</span>'s dugout. As I did so a big fellow
         pitched plunk into the soft shingle between land and water about five or
         six yards behind me and five or six yards in front of Freddie. The slush
         fairly smothered or blanketed the shell but I was wetted through and was
         stung up properly with small gravel. The hardened devils of Anzacs, who
         had taken cover betwixt the shell-proofs built of piles of stores,
         roared with laughter. Very funny--to look at!</p>
      
      
      <p>As the old Turks kept plugging it in fairly hot, I sat quiet in
         <span class="person">Birdwood</span>'s dugout for a quarter of an hour. Then they calmed down and we
         went the rounds of the right trenches. In those held by the Light Horse
         Brigade under Colonel G. de L. Ryrie, encountered Lieutenant Elliot,
         last seen a year ago at Duntroon.</p>
      
      
      <p>Next, met <span class="person">Colonel Sinclair Maclagan</span> commanding <span class="unit">3rd (Australian) Infantry
            Brigade</span>. After that saw the lines of <span class="person">Colonel Smith's</span> Brigade, where
         Major Browne, R.A., showed me a fearful sort of bomb he had just
         patented.</p>
      
      
      <p>At last, rather tired by my long day, made my way back, stopping at
         <span class="person">Birdie</span>'s dugout en route. Boarded the Mosquito; sailed for and reached
         camp without further adventure. General <span class="person">Douglas</span> of the <span class="unit">East Lancs Division</span> is here. He has dined and is staying the night. A melancholy
         man before whose eyes stands constantly the tragic melting away without
         replacement of the most beautiful of the Divisions of Northern <span class="location">England</span>.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>27th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. Blazing hot; wound up my mail letters; fought
         files, flies and irritability; tackled a lot of stuff from Q.M.G. and
         A.G.; won a clear table by tea time. In the evening hung about waiting
         for <span class="person">de Robeck</span> who had signalled over to say he wanted to talk business.
         At the last he couldn't come.</p>
      
      
      <p>The sequel to the letter telling me I'd have to cut the names of
         <span class="unit">battalions</span> out of my Despatch has come in the shape of a War Office
         cable telling me that, if I agree, it is proposed "to have the despatch
         reviewed and a slightly different version prepared for publication." I
         hope my reply to Fitz may arrive in time to prevent too much titivation.</p>
      
      
      <p>An imaginative War Office (were such a thing imaginable) would try first
         of all to rouse public enthusiasm by letting them follow quite closely
         the brave doings of their own boys' units whatever these might be. Next,
         they would try and use the Press to teach the public that there are
         three kinds of war, (a) military war, (b) economic war and (c)
         social war. Lastly, they would explain to the Cabinet that this war of
         ours is a mixture of (a) and (b) with more of (b) than (a) in
         it.</p>
      
      
      <p>How can economic victory be won? (1) by enlisting the sympathy of
         America; (2) by taking <span class="location">Constantinople</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>The idea that we can hustle the Kaiser back over the Rhine and march on
         to Berlin at the double emanates from a school of thought who have
         devoted much study to the French Army, not so much to that of the
         Germans. But we can (no one denies it) hustle the Turks out of
         <span class="location">Constantinople</span> if we will make an effort, big, no doubt, in itself but
         not very big compared to that entailed by a few miles' advance in the
         West. Let us do that and, forthwith, we enlist economics on our side.</p>
      
      
      <p>None of these things can be carried through without the help of the
         Press. Second only to enthusiasm of our own folk comes the sweetening of
         the temper of the neutral. Hard to say at present whether our Censorship
         has done most harm in the U.<span class="person">K.</span> or the <span class="location">U.S.A.</span> Before leaving for the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> I begged hard for Hare and Frederick Palmer, the Americans,
         knowing they would help us with the Yanks just as much as aeroplanes
         would help us with the Turks, but I was turned down on the plea that the
         London Press would be jealous.</p>
      
      
      <p>These are the feelings which have prompted my pen to-day. Writing one of
         the few great men I know I put the matter like this:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"From my individual point of view a hideous mistake has been made on the
         correspondence side of the whole of this <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> business. Had we
         had a dozen good newspaper correspondents here, the vital life-giving
         interest of these stupendous proceedings would have been brought right
         into the hearths and homes of the humblest people in Britain....</p>
      
      
      <p>"As for information to the enemy, this is too puerile altogether. The
         things these fellows produce are all read and checked by competent
         General Staff Officers. To think that it matters to the Turks whether a
         certain trench was taken by the <span class="unit">7th Royal Scots</span> or the 3rd Warwicks is
         just really like children playing at secrets. The Censors who are by way
         of keeping everyone in <span class="location">England</span> in darkness allow extremely accurate
         outline panoramas of the Australian position from the back; trenches,
         communication tracks, etc., all to scale; a true military sketch, to
         appear in the Illustrated London News of 5th June. The wildest
         indiscretions in words could not equal this."</p>
      
      
      <p>Again I say the Press must win. On no subject is there more hypocrisy
         amongst big men in <span class="location">England</span>. They pretend they do not care for the Press
         and sub rosa they try all they are worth to work it. How well I
         remember my Chief of the General Staff coming up to me at a big
         conference on Salisbury Plain where I had spent five very useful minutes
         explaining the inwardness of things to old Bennett Burleigh, the War
         Correspondent. He (the C.G.S.) begged me to see Burleigh privately,
         afterwards, as it would "create a bad impression" were I seen by
         everyone to be on friendly terms with the old man! He meant it very
         kindly: from his point of view he was quite right. I lay no claim to be
         more candid than the rest of them: quite the contrary. Only, over that
         particular line of country, I am more candid. Whenever anyone
         ostentatiously washes his hands of the Press in my hearing I chuckle
         over the memory of the administrator who was admonishing me as to the
         unsuitability of a public servant having a journalistic acquaintance
         when, suddenly, the door opened; the parlour-maid entered and said,
         "Lord Northcliffe is on the 'phone."</p>
      
      
      <p>Have told Lord <span class="person">K.</span> in my letter we have just enough shell for one more
         attack. After that, we fold our hands and wait the arrival of the new
         troops and the new outfit of ammunition:--not "wait and see" but "wait
         and suffer." A month is a desperate long halt to have in a battle. A
         month, at least, to let weariness and sickness spread whilst new armies
         of enemies replace those whose hearts we have broken,--at a cost of how
         many broken hearts, I wonder, in Australasia and <span class="location">England</span>?</p>
      
      
      <p>This enforced pause in our operations is a desperate bad business: for
         to-day there is a feeling in the air--thrilling through the ranks--that
         unitat last the upper hand is ours. Now is the moment to fall on with
         might and main,--to press unrelentingly and without break or pause until
         we wrest victory from Fortune. Morally, we are confident
         but,--materially? Alas, to-morrow, for our last "dart" before
         reinforcements arrive a month hence, my shell only runs to a forty
         minutes' bombardment of some half a mile of the enemy's trenches. We
         simply have not shell wherewith to cover more or keep it up any longer.</p>
      
      
      <p>A General laying down the law to a Field Marshal is as obnoxious to
         military "form" as a vacuum was once supposed to be to the sentiments of
         nature. The child, who teaches its grandmother to suck eggs, commits a
         venial fault in comparison. So I have had to convey my precepts
         insensibly to Milord <span class="person">K.</span>--to convey them in homeopathic doses of parable.
         The brilliant French success of the 21st-22nd, I explain to him, was due
         to the showers of shell wherewith they deluged the Turkish lines until
         their defenders were sitting dazed with their dugouts in ruins about
         them. Also, in the same epistle, I have tried to explain Anzac.</p>
      
      
      <p>In the domain of tactics our landing at <span class="location">Helles</span> speaks for itself. Since
         gunpowder was invented nothing finer than the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> has been
         achieved. But it will be a long time yet before people grasp that the
         landing at Anzac is just as remarkable in the imaginative domain of
         strategy. The military student of the future will, I hope and believe,
         realize the significance of the stroke whereby we are hourly forcing a
         great Empire to commit hari kiri upon these barren, worthless
         cliffs--whereby we keep pressing a dagger exactly over the black heart
         of the Ottoman Raj. Only skin deep--so far; only through the skin. Yet
         already how freely bleeds the wound. Daily the effort to escape this
         doom; to push away the threat of that painful point will increase. Even
         if we were never to make another yard's advance,--here--in the cove of
         Anzac--is the cup into which the life blood of the Caliphat shall be
         pressed. And on the whole <span class="location">Gallipoli Peninsula</span> this little cove is the
         one and only spot whereon a base could have been established, which is
         sheltered (to a bearable extent) from the force of the enemy's fire.
         Dead ground; defiladed from inland batteries; deep water right close to
         the shore!</p>
      
      
      <p>Enver dares not leave Anzac alone. We are too near his neck; the
         Narrows!! So on this most precarious, God-forsaken spot he must maintain
         an Army of his best troops, mostly supplied by sea,--by sea whereon our
         submarines swallow 25 per cent. of their drafts, munitions and food,
         just as a pike takes down the duckling before the eyes of their mother
         on a pond. Hold fast's the word. We have only to keep our grip firm and
         fast; <span class="location">Turkey</span> will die of exhaustion trying to do what she can't do;
         drive us into the sea!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person"> Braithwaite</span> and Amery dined. Great fun seeing Amery again. What
         memories of his concealment in the Autocrat's "Special" going to the
         Vereeniging Conference; of our efforts to create a strategical training
         ground for British troops in <span class="location">South Africa</span>; of our battles against one
         another over the great Voluntary Service issue.</p>

      <p>CHAPTER XII A VICTORY AND AFTER
         </p>
      
      
      
      <p>
         28th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. The fateful day.</p>
      
      
      <p>Left camp with <span class="person"> Braithwaite</span>, <span class="person">Dawnay</span> and Ward. Embarked on the destroyer
         unitColne (Commander Seymour) and sailed for <span class="location">Helles</span>. The fire fight was
         raging. From the bridge we got a fine view as our guns were being
         focused on and about the north-west coast. The cliff line and half a
         mile inland is shrouded in a pall of yellow dust which, as it twirls,
         twists and eddies, blots out Achi Baba himself. Through this curtain
         appear, dozens at a time, little balls of white,--the shrapnel searching
         out the communication trenches and cutting the wire entanglements. At
         other times spouts of green or black vapour rise, mix and lose
         themselves in the yellow cloud. The noise is like the rumbling of an
         express train--continuous; no break at all. The Turks sitting there in
         their trenches--our men 100 yards away sitting in their trenches! What
         a wonderful change in the art,--no not the art, in the mechanism--of
         war. Fifteen years ago armies would have stood aghast at our display of
         explosive energy; to-day we know that our shortage is pitiable and that
         we are very short of stuff; perilously short.--(Written in the cabin of
         the Colne.)</p>
      
      
      <p>Jimmy Watson met me on the pier. He is Commandant Advance Base. Deedes
         also met me and the whole band of us made our way inland to my battle
         dugout. This is probably our last onslaught before the new troops and
         new supplies of shell come to hand in about a month from now. We have
         just enough stuff to deal with one narrow strip by the coast. Had it not
         been for some help from the French, we could not have entered upon this
         engagement at all, but must have continued to sit still and be shot
         at--rather an expensive way of fighting if John Bull could only be told
         the truth. Now, although the area is limited the battle is a big one,
         fairly entitled to be called a general action. As I said, the French are
         helping <span class="person">Simpson-Baikie</span> in his bombardment; the Fleet are helping us with
         the fire of the <span class="location">Scorpion</span>, <span class="location">Talbot</span> and <span class="location">Wolverine</span>, and <span class="person">Birdwood</span> has
         been asked to try and help us from Anzac by making a push there to hold
         the enemy and prevent him sending reinforcements south. On their side
         the Turks are making a very feeble reply. Looks as if we had caught them
         with their ammunition parks empty.</p>
      
      
      <p>I went into the dugout indescribably slack; hardly energy to struggle
         against the heat and the myriads of flies. I came out of it radiant. The
         Turks are beat. Five lines of their best trenches carried (or, at least,
         four regular lines plus a bit extra); the Boomerang Redoubt rushed, and
         in two successive attacks we have advanced 1,000 yards. Our losses are
         said to be moderate. The dreaded Boomerang collapsed and was stormed
         with hardly a casualty. This was owing partly to the two trench mortars
         lent us by the French and partly to the extraordinary fine shooting of
         our own battery of 4.5 howitzers. The whole show went like
         clockwork--like a Field Day. First the <span class="unit">87th Brigade</span> took three lines of
         trenches; then our guns lengthened their range and fuses and the <span class="unit">86th Brigade</span>, with the gallant Royal Fusiliers at their head, scrambled over
         the trenches already taken by the <span class="unit">87th</span>, and took the last two lines in
         splendid style. We could have gone right on but we had nothing to go on
         with. How I wish the whole world and his wife could have been here to
         see our lines advancing under fire quite steadily with intervals and
         dressing as on parade. A wonderful show!</p>
      
      
      <p>As the <span class="unit">87th Brigade</span> left the trenches at 11 a.m., the enemy opened a hot
         shrapnel fire on them but although some men fell, none faltered as we
         could see very well owing to the following device. The 29th attackers
         had sewn on to their backs triangles cut out of kerosine tins. The idea
         was to let these bright bits of metal flash in the sunlight and act as
         helios. Thus our guns would be able to keep an eye on them. The
         spectacle was extraordinary. From my post I could follow the movements
         of every man. One moment after 11 a.m. the smoke pall lifted and moved
         slowly on with a thousand sparkles of light in its wake: as if someone
         had quite suddenly flung a big handful of diamonds on to the landscape.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 11.30 the <span class="unit">86th Brigade</span> likewise advanced; passed through the 87th and
         took two more lines of trenches.</p>
      
      
      <p>At mid-day I signalled, "Well done <span class="unit">29th Division</span> and <span class="unit">156th Brigade</span>. Am
         watching your splendid attack with admiration. Stick to it and your
         names will become famous in your homes."</p>
      
      
      <p>At 1.50 I got a reply, "Thanks from all ranks 29th. We are here to
         stay."</p>
      
      
      <p>At 3.15 I ran across and warmly congratulated Hunter-Weston, staying
         with him reading the messages until about 4 p.m. when I went on to see
         Gouraud. Hunter-Weston,<span class="person"> Gouraud</span> and <span class="person"> Braithwaite</span> agree that:--had we
         only shell to repeat our bombardment of this morning, now, we could go
         on another 1,000 yards before dark,--result, Achi Baba to-morrow, or, at
         the latest, the day after; Achi Baba and fifty guns perhaps with, say,
         10,000 prisoners.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 5 p.m.<span class="person"> Gouraud</span> and I walked back to Hunter-Weston's G.H.Q. A load was
         off our minds--we were wonderfully happy. At 5.30 a message from <span class="person">Birdie</span>
         to say the Queenslanders had thrust out towards <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span> and had
         "drawn" the Turkish reserves who had been badly hammered by our guns.
         With this crowning mercy in my pocket, walked down and boarded the
         destroyer Scourge (Lieutenant Tupper) and got back to camp before
         seven. What a day! May our glorious <span class="unit">Infantry</span> gain everlasting
         Kudos--and the Gunners, too, may the good use they made of their shell
         ration create a legend.</p>
      
      
      <p>The French official photographer has fixed a moment by snapping<span class="person"> Gouraud</span>
         and myself overlooking the <span class="location">Helles</span>pont from the old battlements.</p>

      <p>Midnight.--When I lay down in my little tent two hours ago the canvas
         seemed to make a sort of sounding board. No sooner did I try to sleep
         than I heard the musketry rolling up and dying away; then rolling up
         again in volume until I could stick it no longer and simply had to get
         up and pick a path, through the brush and over sandhills, across to the
         sea on the East coast of our island. There I could hear nothing. Was the
         firing then an hallucination--a sort of sequel to the battle in my
         brain? Not so; far away I could see faint corruscations of sparks; star
         shells; coloured fire balls from pistols; searchlights playing up and
         down the coast. Our fellows were being hard beset to hold on to what
         they had won; there, where the horizon stood out with spectral
         luminosity. What a contrast; the direct fear, joy, and excitement of the
         fighting men out there in the searchlights and the dull anguish of
         waiting here in the darkness; imagining horrors; praying the Almighty
         our men may be vouchsafed valour to stick it through the night;
         wondering, waiting until the wire brings its colourless message!</p>
      
      
      <p>One thought I have which is in the end a sure sleep-getter--the
         advancing death. Whether by hours or by years, by inches or by leagues,
         by bullets or bacilli, we struggle-for-lifers will very soon struggle no
         more. My last salaams are well-nigh due to my audience and to the stage.
         That rare and curious being called I is more fragile than any porcelain
         jar. How on earth it has preserved itself so long, heaven only knows.
         One pellet of lead, it falls in a heap of dust; the Peninsula
         disappears; the fighting men fall asleep; the world and its glories
         become a blank--not even a dream--nothing!</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>29th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. Sunlight has scattered the spectres of the
         night,--they have fled, leaving behind them only the matter-of-fact
         residuum of heavy Turkish counter-attacks against our fresh-won ground.
         The fighting took place along the coastline, and the stillness of the
         night seems to have helped the sounds of musketry across the twelve
         miles of sea. The attack was most determined: repulsed by bombs and with
         the bayonet: at daylight the enemy came under a cross-fire of machine
         guns and rifles and were shot to pieces.</p>
      
      
      <p>Very early approved the revise of my long cable (for the Cabinet)
         outlining my hopes and fears:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F. 381). From General Sir  <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span> to  <span class="person">Earl Kitchener</span>. With
         reference to your telegram No. 5770, cipher. As the Cabinet are anxious
         to consider my situation in all its bearings, it is necessary I should
         open to you all my mind. In my No. M.F. 328 of 13th June, I gave you an
         outline of my plan, based on the news that I was to be given new
         divisions, and I told you what I should do with a possible fourth
         division in my No. M.F. 364 of 23rd June. I am now asked whether I
         consider a fifth division advisable and necessary.</p>
      
      
      <p>"I have taken time to answer this question, as the addition of each new
         division necessitates, in such a theatre of war as this, a
         reconsideration of the whole strategical and tactical situation as well
         as of the power of the Fleet to work up to the increased demands that
         would be placed upon it. The scheme which might tempt me (Naval
         considerations permitting) of landing the <span class="unit">4th and 5th Divisions</span> together
         with the three divisions and one or two divisions from Cape <span class="location">Helles</span> and
         Anzac on flank of shore of Gulf of Saros to march on Rodosto and
         <span class="location">Constantinople</span> I reject because the <span class="unit">4th and 5th Divisions</span> cannot reach
         me simultaneously with all their transport.</p>
      
      
      <p>"But assuming that reinforcements can only reach me in echelon of
         divisions I have decided that the best policy would be to adhere to my
         original plan of endeavouring to turn the enemy's right at Anzac with
         the first three divisions and to gain a position from <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span> to
         Maidos. I should then use the <span class="unit">4th and 5th Divisions</span>, in case of
         non-success at first to reinforce this wing, and in case of success
         possibly to effect a landing on the southern shore of the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>;
         and since the enemy's forces south of the Straits would probably have
         been reduced to a minimum in order to oppose my reinforced strength on
         the Peninsula I should in the latter case count upon these two divisions
         doing more than hold a bridge-head (see my M.F. 349 of 19th June), and
         should expect them, reinforced from the northern wing if necessary, to
         press forward to Chanak and thus to cut off this enemy's sole remaining
         line of supply.[22] By these means I should hope to compel the
         surrender of the whole Gallipoli Army. Meanwhile, with my force on the
         Asiatic side I would be enabled to establish in Morto Bay a base safe
         from the bad weather which must be expected later on.</p>
      
      
      <p>"With regard to ammunition, the more we can get the more easy will our
         task be, but I hope we may be able to achieve success at the end of July
         with the amount available. As we are so far from home, however, we
         cannot afford to run things too fine, and we shall always be obliged to
         keep up a large reserve until the arrival of further supply. I should,
         therefore, like as much as you can spare, particularly high explosive.
         So far as this question affects sending a <span class="unit">4th and 5th Divisions</span> I would
         not refuse them on the score of ammunition alone, because with the
         Artillery of three new divisions complete I think we shall have as many
         guns as the terrain will allow us to use in the operations towards
         Maidos, and also sufficient to compete with any Artillery which the
         enemy could bring against the detachment operating on the Asiatic shore.</p>
      
      
      <p>"To summarize--I think I have reasonable prospects of eventual success
         with three divisions, with four the risks of miscalculation would be
         minimized, and with five, even if the fifth division had little or no
         gun ammunition, I think it would be a much simpler matter to clear the
         Asiatic shore subsequently of big guns, etc., Kilid Bahr would be
         captured at an earlier date and success would be generally assured."</p>
      
      
      <p>Next, I boiled down yesterday's battle into telegraphic dispatch form:</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F. 383). From General Sir  <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span> to Secretary of State for
         War. In continuation of my Nos. M.F. 379 and 382. Plan of operations
         yesterday was to throw forward left of my line south-east of <span class="location"> Krithia </span>,
         pivoting on point about one mile from the sea, and after advancing
         extreme left for about half a mile, to establish new line facing east on
         ground thus gained. This plan entailed the capture in succession of two
         lines of the Turkish trenches east of the Saghir Dere and five lines of
         trenches west of it. Australian Corps was ordered to co-operate by
         making vigorous demonstration. The action opened at 9 a.m. with
         bombardment by heavy artillery of the trenches to be captured.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Assistance rendered by French in this bombardment was most valuable. At
         10.20 our field artillery opened fire to cut wire in front of Turkish
         trenches and this was effectively done. Great effect on enemy's trench
         near sea and in keeping down his artillery fire from that quarter was
         produced by very accurate fire of <span class="location">H.M.S. Talbot</span>,<span class="location">Scorpion</span>, and <span class="location">Wolverine</span>. At 10.45 a small Turkish advanced work in the Saghir Dere,
         known as the Boomerang Redoubt, was assaulted. This little fort was
         very strongly sited, protected by extra strong wire entanglements and
         has long been a source of trouble. After special bombardment by trench
         mortars and while bombardment of surrounding trenches was at its height
         part of Border Regiment, at the exact moment prescribed, leapt from
         their trenches like a pack of hounds pouring out of cover, raced across
         and took the work most brilliantly.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Artillery bombardment increased in intensity till 11 a.m. when range
         was lengthened and infantry advanced. <span class="unit">Infantry</span> attack was carried out
         with great dash along whole line. West of Saghir Dere <span class="unit">87th Brigade</span>
         captured three lines of trenches with little opposition. Trenches full
         of dead Turks, many buried by bombardment, and 100 prisoners were taken
         in them. East of Ravine two <span class="unit">battalions</span> Royal Scots made fine attack,
         capturing the two lines of trenches assigned as their objective, but
         remainder of <span class="unit">156th Brigade</span> on their right met severe opposition and were
         unable to get forward. At 11.30, <span class="unit">86th Brigade</span> led by 2nd Bn. Royal
         Fusiliers started second phase of attack West of Ravine. They advanced
         with great steadiness and resolution through trenches already captured
         and on across the open, and taking two more lines of trenches reached
         objective allotted to them, Lancashire Fusiliers inclining half right
         and forming line to connect with our new position East of Ravine.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The northernmost objective I had set out to reach had now been
         attained, but the Gurkhas pressing on under the cliffs captured an
         important knoll still further forward, actually due west of <span class="location"> Krithia </span>.
         This they fortified and held during the night, making our total gain on
         the left precisely 1,000 yards. During afternoon 88th Brigade attacked
         trenches, small portion of which remained uncaptured on right, but enemy
         held on stubbornly, supported by machine guns and artillery, and attacks
         did not succeed. During night enemy counter-attacked furthest trenches
         gained but was repulsed with heavy loss. Party of Turks who penetrated
         from flank between two lines of captured trenches, subjected to
         machine-gun fire at daybreak, suffered very heavily and survivors
         surrendered.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Except for small portion of trench already mentioned which is still
         held by enemy, all, and more than we hoped for, from operations has been
         gained. On extreme left, line has been pushed forward to specially
         strong point well beyond limit of advance originally contemplated. Our
         casualties about 2,000, the greater proportion of which are slight cases
         of which 250 at Anzac, in the useful demonstration made simultaneously
         there. All engaged did well, but certainly the chief factor in the
         success was the splendid attack carried out by <span class="unit">XXIXth Division</span>, whose
         conduct in this as on previous occasions was beyond praise."</p>
      
      
      <p>Lastly, I wrote out a special Force Order thanking the incomparable
         29th.</p>
      
      
      <p>Winter brought me over a letter just received from <span class="person">Wallace</span>. He is
         quarrelling with Elliot. For that I don't blame him. At the end of his
         letter <span class="person">Wallace</span> says, "I feel that the organization of the Lines of
         Communication and making it work is such a task that I sometimes doubt
         myself whether I am equal to it." <span class="person">Wallace</span> is a good fellow and a
         sensible man placed, by British methods, out of his element and out of
         his depth. Have told Winter to tell him I sympathize and will help him
         and support him all I know; that if it turns out his strong points lie
         in another direction than administering a huge business machine, I will
         try and find a handsome way out for him.</p>
      
      
      <p>Had been writing, writing, writing since cockcrow so when I heard a
         trawler was going over with two of the General Staff at mid-day, I could
         not resist the chance of another visit to the scene of yesterday's
         victorious advance. Went to see Hunter-Weston but he was up at the front
         where I had no time to follow him. His Chief of Staff says all goes
         well, but they have just had cables from my own Headquarters to tell
         them that heavy columns of Turks are massing behind Achi Baba for a
         fresh counter-attack. Thought, therefore, the wisest thing was to get
         back quickly. Reached camp again about 7 p.m., and found more news in
         office than I got on the spot. Last night's firing on the Peninsula
         meant close and desperate fighting. Several heavy columns of Turks
         attacked with bomb and bayonet, and in places some of their braves broke
         through into our new trenches where the defence had not yet been put on
         a stable footing. When daylight came we got them enfiladed by machine
         guns and every single mother's son of them was either killed or
         captured. So we still hold every yard we had gained.</p>
      
      
      <p>The attack by a part of the <span class="unit">Lowland Division</span> seems to have been
         mishandled. A Brigade made the assault East of the Ravine; the men
         advanced gallantly but there was lack of effective preparation. Two
         <span class="unit">battalions</span> of the Royal Scots carried a couple of the enemy's trenches
         in fine style and stuck to them, but the rest of the Brigade lost a
         number of good men to no useful purpose in their push against H.12. One
         thing is clear. If the bombardment was ineffective, from whatever cause,
         then the men should not have been allowed to break cover.[23]</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>30th June, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. Writing in camp.</p>
      
      
      <p>More good news. It never rains but it pours. The French have made a fine
         push and got the Quadrilateral by 8 a.m. with but little loss. The Turks
         seemed discouraged, they say, and did not offer their usual firm
         resistance.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 10.30 a.m. wired<span class="person"> Gouraud</span>:--"Warm congratulations on this morning's
         work which will compensate for the loss of your 2,000 quarts of wine.
         Your Government should now replace it with vintage claret. Please send
         me quickly a sketch of the ground you have gained."</p>
      
      
      <p>Gouraud now replies:--"Best thanks for congratulations. Sketch being
         made. If our Government is pleased to send a finer brand of wine to
         replace what was wasted by the guns of Asia, we Frenchmen will drink it
         to the very good health of our British comrades in arms."</p>
      
      
      <p>How lucky I signalled <span class="person">de Robeck</span> 8 p.m. yesterday to let us keep the
         <span class="location">Wolverine</span> and <span class="location">Scorpion</span> "in case of a night attack!" Sure enough
         there was another onslaught made against our northernmost post. Two
         Turkish Regiments were discovered in mass creeping along the top of the
         cliffs by the searchlights of the <span class="location">Scorpion</span>. They were so punished by
         her guns that they were completely broken up and the <span class="unit">Infantry</span> at
         daylight had not much to do except pick up the fragments. 300 Turks lay
         dead upon the ground. Also, hiding in furze, have gleaned 180 prisoners
         belonging to the <span class="unit">13th, 16th and 33rd Regiments</span>. A Circassian prisoner
         carried in a wounded Royal Scot on his back under a heavy fire.</p>
      
      
      <p>Three wires from <span class="location">Helles</span>; the first early this morning; the last just to
         hand (11 p.m.) saying that the lack of hand grenades is endangering all
         our gains. The Turks are much better armed in this respect. <span class="person">De Lisle</span>
         says that where we have hand grenades we can advance still further;
         where we have not, we lose ground. At mid-day, we wired our reply saying
         we had no more hand grenades we feared but that we would do our best to
         scrape up a few; also that several trench mortars had just arrived from
         home and that they would be sent over forthwith.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have returned some interesting minutes on the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>, sent me from
         home, with this remark:--"Looking back I see now clearly that the one
         fallacy which crept into your plans was non-recognition of the pride and
         military moralunit of the Turk. There was never any question of the Turk
         being demoralized or even flustered by ships sailing past him or by
         troops landing in his rear. At last, I believe, this moral is
         beginning to crack up a little (not much) but nothing less than
         murderous losses would have done it. In their diaries their officers
         speak of this Peninsula as the Slaughterhouse."</p>
      
      
      <p>Brigadier-General  <span class="person">de Lothbiniere</span> and Major Ruthven lunched and young
         Brodrick and I dined together on board the Triad with the hospitable
         Vice-Admiral. We were all very cheery at the happy turn of our fortunes;
         outwardly, that is to say, for there was a skeleton at the feast who
         kept tap, tap, tapping on the mahogany with his bony knuckles; tap, tap,
         tap; the gunfire at <span class="location">Helles</span> was insistent, warning us that the Turks had
         not yet "taken their licking." But when I get back, although there is
         nothing in from Hunter-Weston there is an officer from Anzac who has
         just given me the complete story of <span class="person">Birdwood</span>'s demonstration on the
         28th. The tide of war is indeed racing full flood in our favour.</p>
      
      
      <p>When we were working out our scheme for the attack of the <span class="unit">29th Division</span>
         and 156th Brigade the day before yesterday, as well as<span class="person"> Gouraud</span>'s attack
         of yesterday, we had reckoned that the Turkish High Command would get to
         realize by about 11 a.m. on the 28th that an uncommon stiff fight had
         been set afoot to the sou'-west of <span class="location"> Krithia </span>. L. von S. would then, it
         might be surmised, draw upon his reserves at Maidos and upon his forces
         opposite Anzac: they would get their orders about mid-day: they would be
         starting about 1 p.m.: they would reach <span class="location"> Krithia </span> about dusk: they would
         use their "pull" in the matter of hand grenades to counter-attack by
         moonlight. So we asked <span class="person">Birdie</span> to make one of his most engaging gestures
         just to delay these reinforcements a little bit; and now it turns out
         that the Australians and New Zealanders in their handsome, antipodean
         style went some 50 per cent. better than their bargain:--</p>
      
      
      <p>(1) At 1 p.m. on the 28th the Queensland giants darted out of their
         caves and went for the low ridge covering <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span>, that tenderest spot
         of the Turks. They got on to the foot of it and, by their dashing
         onslaught, drew the fire of all the enemy guns; but, what was still
         better, heavy Turkish columns, on the march, evidently, from Maidos to
         the help of <span class="location"> Krithia </span>, turned back northwards and closed in for the
         defence of <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span>. As they drew near they came under fire of our
         destroyers and of the Anzac guns and were badly knocked about and broken
         up. So both <span class="location"> Krithia </span> and the French Quadrilateral have had to do without
         the help of these reinforcements from the reserves of <span class="person">Liman von Sanders</span>.
         One of the neatest of strokes and the credit of it lies with the
         Queenslanders who were not content to flourish their fists in the
         enemy's face but ran out and attacked him at close quarters.</p>
      
      
      <p>(2) Now comes the sequel! <span class="person">Birdie</span> has just sent in word of the best
         business done at Anzac since May 19th!! The success of his demonstration
         towards <span class="location"> Gaba Tepe </span> had given the Turks a bad attack of the jumps,
         followed by a thirst for vengeance. Yesterday, they got very nervy
         during a dust storm and for two hours the whole of their Army kept up
         high pressure fire from every rifle and machine gun they could bring to
         bear. They simply poured out bullets by the million into the blinding
         dust. Things then gradually quieted down till 1.30 this morning when a
         very serious assault--very serious for the enemy--was suddenly launched
         against the Anzac left, the brunt of it falling on Russell's New Zealand
         Mounted Rifles and Chauvel's Australian Light Horse; a bad choice too!
         Our victory complete; bloodless for us. Their defeat complete; very
         bloody. Nine fresh enemy <span class="unit">battalions</span> smashed to bits: fighting went on
         until dawn: five hundred Turks laid out and counted: no more detail but
         that is good enough to go to sleep upon.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>1st July, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. Good news from <span class="location">Helles</span> continues. In the early
         hours of last night an attack was made on the Gurkhas in J trenches.
         When they ran out of bombs the Turks bombed them out. Headed by Bruce
         their Colonel, whom they adore, they retook the trench and, for the
         first time, got into the enemy with their kukris and sliced off a
         number of their heads. At dawn half a <span class="unit">battalion</span> of Turks tried to make
         the attack along the top of the cliff and were entirely wiped out.</p>
      
      
      <p>Against this I must set down cruel bad news about<span class="person"> Gouraud</span>. An accursed
         misadventure. He has been severely wounded by a shell. Directly I heard
         I got the Navy to run me over. He was already in the Hospital ship; I
         saw him there. A pure toss up whether he pulls round or not; luckily he
         has a frame of iron. I was allowed to speak to him for half a minute and
         he is full of pluck. The shell, an 8-incher from Asia, landed only some
         half a dozen yards away from him as he was visiting his wounded and sick
         down by "V" Beach. By some miracle none of the metal fragments touched
         him, but the sheer force of the explosion shot him up into the air and
         over a wall said to be seven feet high. His thigh, ankle and arm are all
         badly smashed, simply by the fall. We could more easily spare a Brigade.
         His loss is irreparable. By personal magnetism he has raised the ardour
         of his troops to the highest power. Have cabled to Lord <span class="person">K.</span> expressing my
         profound sorrow and assuring him that "the grave loss suffered by the
         French, and indirectly by my whole force," is really most serious, as I
         know, I say, "the French War Minister cannot send us another General
         Gouraud."</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>2nd July, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. Worked all day in camp. <span class="person">Birdie</span>, with Onslow,
         his A.D.C--such a nice boy--came over from Anzac in the morning and
         stayed with me the day, during which we worked together at our plan. At
         night we all went over together to <span class="location">H.M.S. Triad</span> to dine with the
         Vice-Admiral.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Birdwood</span> is quite confident that with a fresh Division and a decent
         supply of shell he can get hold of the heights of Sari Bair, whereby he
         will enfilade the whole network of Turkish trenches, now hedging him
         round. The only thing he bargains for is that G.H.Q. so work the whole
         affair from orders down to movements, that the enemy get no inkling of
         our intentions. The Turks so far suspect nothing, and Koja Chemen Tepe
         and Chunuk Bair, with all the intervening ridge, are still unentrenched
         and open to capture by a coup-de-main. Even if the naval objections to
         Bulair could be overcome, Sari Bair remains the better move of the two.
         With the high ridges of Sari Bair in our hands we could put a stop to
         the Turkish sea transport from Chanak which we could neither see nor
         touch from Bulair. The tugs with their strings of lighters could not run
         by day, and as soon as we could get searchlights fixed up, they would
         find it very awkward to show themselves in the Straits by night. As to
         the enemy land communications, as soon as we can haul up our big guns we
         should command, and be able to search, all the ground between the Aegean
         and the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>. Now is the moment. <span class="person">Birdwood</span> says that he and his
         men have exactly the same feeling that we have down at <span class="location">Helles</span>--the
         feeling, namely, that now at last, we have got a right moral pull over
         the Turks. All we want is enough material to turn that faith into a mile
         or two of mountains.</p>
      
      
      <p>Making full use of their advantage in hand grenades, the Turks again won
         their trench back from the Gurkhas last night; a trench which was the
         key to a whole system of earthworks. Bruce had been wounded and they had
         no officers left to lead them, so <span class="person">de Lisle</span> had to call once more on the
         <span class="unit">29th Division</span> and the bold Inniskilling Fusiliers retook that trench at
         a cost of all their officers save two.</p>
      
      
      <p>There are some feats of arms best left to speak for themselves and this
         is one of them.</p>
      
      
      <p>Wrote Lord <span class="person">K.</span> as follows:--</p>
      
      
      <p>                                                "GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,

      <p>                                                     "2nd July, 1915.</p>
      
      
      <p>    "Dictated.</p>
      
      
      <p>  "MY DEAR <span class="person">LORD KITCHENER</span>,</p>
      
      
      <p>"There seems to be a lull in this tooth-and-nail struggle which has kept
         me on tenterhooks during the past four days and nights. But we have on
         our maps little blue arrows showing the movements of at least a Division
         of troops in various little columns from above Kereves Dere, from Soghon
         Dere river, from Kilid Bahr and even from within gun-shot of Achi Baba,
         all converging on a point a mile or two north-west of <span class="location"> Krithia </span>. So it
         looks as if they were going to have one more desperate go at the Gurkha
         knoll due west of <span class="location"> Krithia </span>, and at the line of trench we call J.13
         immediately behind it which was also held by the Gurkhas.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Last night they bombed the Gurkhas out of the eastern half of J.13 and
         the Inniskilling Fusiliers had to take it again at the point of the
         bayonet just as day broke.</p>
      
      
      <p>"You can have small idea of what the troops are going through. The same
         old <span class="unit">battalions</span> being called on again and again to do the forlorn hope
         sort of business. However, each day that passes, these captured
         positions get better dug in, and make the Turks' counter-attack more
         costly.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The cause of the attack made the night before last on Anzac has been
         made quite clear to us by a highly intelligent Armenian prisoner we have
         taken. The strictest orders had been issued by His Excellency
         Commanding-in-Chief on the Peninsula that no further attacks against our
         works were to be made unless, of course, we took any ground from them
         when we must be vigorously countered. But it was explained to the men
         that the losses in attack had proved too heavy, whereas, if they had
         patience and waited a week or ten days in their trenches, then at last
         we would come out and try to attack them when they would kill us in
         great quantities. However, Enver Pasha appeared in person amongst the
         troops at Anzac, and ordered three regiments to attack whilst the whole
         of the rest of the line supported them by demonstrations and by fire. It
         was objected this was against the command of their local chief. He
         brushed this objection aside, and told them never to look him in the
         face again if they failed to drive the Australians into the sea. So off
         they went and they certainly did not drive the Australians into the sea
         (although they got into their support trenches at one time) and
         certainly most of them never looked Enver in the face again, or anyone
         else for that matter.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The old battle tactics have clean vanished. I have only quite lately
         realized the new conditions. Whether your entrenchments are on the top
         of a hill or at the bottom of a valley matters precious little: whether
         you are outflanked matters precious little--you may hold one half of a
         straight trench and the enemy may hold the other half, and this
         situation may endure for weeks. The only thing is by cunning or
         surprise, or skill, or tremendous expenditure of high explosives, or
         great expenditure of good troops, to win some small tactical position
         which the enemy may be bound, perhaps for military or perhaps for
         political reasons, to attack. Then you can begin to kill them pretty
         fast."</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>3rd July, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. Very hot; very limp with the prevalent disease
         but greatly cheered up by the news of yesterday evening's battle at
         <span class="location">Helles</span>. The Turks must have got hold of a lot of fresh shell for, at
         5.30 p.m., they began as heavy a bombardment as any yet seen at <span class="location">Helles</span>,
         concentrating on our extreme left. We could only send a feeble reply. At
         6 o'clock the enemy advanced in swarms, but before they had covered more
         than 100 yards they were driven back again into the Ravine some 800
         yards to our front. <span class="location">H.M.S. Scorpion</span> and our machine guns played the
         chief hand. At 7 p.m. the Turkish guns began again, blazing away as if
         shells were a drug in the market, whilst, under cover of this very
         intense fire, another two of their <span class="unit">battalions</span> had the nerve to emerge
         from the Ravine to the north-east of our forward trenches and to move in
         regular lines--shoulder to shoulder--right across the open. Hardly had
         they shown themselves when the <span class="unit">10th Battery R.F.A.</span> sprayed them
         beautifully with shrapnel. The Gurkha supports were rushed up, and as
         there was no room for them in the fire trenches they crept into shell
         craters and any sort of hole they could find from which to rake the
         Turks as they made their advance. The enemy's officers greatly
         distinguished themselves, waving their swords and running well out into
         the open to get the men forward. The men also had screwed up their
         courage to the sticking point and made a big push for it, but, in the
         end, they could not face our fire, and fell back helter-skelter to their
         mullah. Along the spot where they had stood wavering awhile before they
         broke and ran, there are still two clearly marked lines of corpses.</p>
      
      
      <p>Wrote a letter to Sclater saying I cannot understand his request for
         fuller information about the drafts needed to make my units up to
         strength. We have regularly cabled strengths; the figures are correct
         and it is the A.G. himself who has ordered us to furnish the optimistic
         "ration" strengths instead of the customary "fighting" strengths. The
         ration strength are for the Q.M.G., but unless the A.G. wishes to go on
         living in a fool's paradise, why should he be afraid of knowing the
         numbers we cannot put into the line of battle!</p>
      
      
      <p>Have also written Cowans protesting once more that we should have
         business brains to run the most intricate business proposition at
         present on tap in the world--our communications. During the past month
         the confusion at <span class="person">Mudros</span>, our advanced base, becomes daily worse
         confounded. Things meant for Anzac go to <span class="location">Helles</span>, and vice versa: or,
         not infrequently, stores, supplies or luxuries arrive and are sent off
         on a little tour to Alexandria and <span class="location">Malta</span> before delivery. The system
         would be perfect for the mellowing of port or madeira, but when it is
         applied to plum and apple jam or, when 18 pr. shell are sent to
         howitzers, the system needs overhauling. I know the job is out of the
         way difficult. There is work here for Lesseps, Goethals and Morgan
         rolled into one:--work that may change the face of the world far, far
         more than the Suez or Panama Canals and, to do it, they have put in a
         good fighting soldier, quite out of his setting, and merely because they
         did not know what to do with him in <span class="location">Egypt</span>! In case Cowans shares <span class="person">K.</span>'s
         suspicions about my sneaking desire for <span class="person">Ellison</span>, I say, "I assure you;
         most solemnly I assure you, that the personal equation does not, even in
         the vaguest fashion, enter into my thoughts. Put the greatest enemy I
         possess in the world, and the person I most dislike, into that post, and
         I would thank God for his appointment, on my knees, provided he was a
         competent business man."</p>
      
      
      <p>Again:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"I am in despair myself over it. Perhaps that is putting it rather
         strong as I try never to despair, but seriously I worry just as much
         over things behind me as I do over the enemy in front of me. What I want
         is a really big man there, and I don't care one D. who he is. A man I
         mean who, if he saw the real necessity, would wire for a great English
         contractor and 300 navvies without bothering or referring the matter to
         anyone."</p>
      
      
      <p>A cable to say that the editing of my despatch is ended, and that the
         public will be let into its dreadful secrets in a day or two. But, I am
         informed there are passages in it whose "secret nature will be
         scrupulously observed." What passages? I cannot remember any secrets in
         my despatch.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have been defending myself desperately against the War Office who want
         to send out a Naval Doctor to take full charge and responsibility for
         the wounded (including destination) the moment they quit dry land. But
         we must have a complete scheme of evacuation by land and sea, not two
         badly jointed schemes. So I have asked, who is to be "Boss"? Who is to
         see to it that the two halves fit together? The answer is that the War
         Office are confident "there will be no friction" (bless them!); they
         say, "nothing could be simpler than this arrangement and no difficulty
         is anticipated. Neither is boss and the boundary between the different
         spheres of activity of the two officers might be laid down as the
         high-water mark." (Bless them again!). Have replied:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"I have struggled with your high-water mark silently for weeks and know
         something about it. Had I bothered you with all my troubles you would, I
         respectfully submit, realize that your proposal is not simple but
         extraordinarily complicated, even pre-supposing seraphic dispositions on
         either side. If you determine finally that these two officers are to be
         independent, I foresee that you will greatly widen the scope of dual
         control which is now only applicable to my great friend the Admiral and
         myself.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Either Babtie must order up the ships when and where he wants them, or
         Porter must order the wounded down when he is ready for them. This is
         my considered opinion."[24]</p>
      
      
      <p>Have also sent an earnest message to <span class="person">K.</span>--just the old, old story--saying
         that what I want first is drafts, and only second fresh divisions.
         My old Chief has been his kind self again:--so very considerate has he
         been in his recent messages that I feel it almost brutal to press him or
         to seem to wish to take advantage of his goodness. But we are dealing
         with lives of men and I must try and make myself clear:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"I am anxious with regard to the question of reinforcements for units.
         During the period 28th to 30th June, the Brigades of the <span class="unit">XXIXth</span> and
         <span class="unit">Lowland</span> Divisions dropped in strengths approximately as follows:--86th
         from 71 officers, 2,807 others to 36 and 1,994; 87th from 65 and 2,724
         to 48 and 2,075; 88th from 63 and 2,139 to 46 and 1,765; 156th from 102
         and 2,839 to 30 and 1,399. All Officers who have arrived from <span class="location">England</span> to
         date are included in the above figures. <span class="person">Maxwell</span> has agreed to let me
         have 80 young Officers from <span class="location">Egypt</span>. Of the other ranks I have no
         appreciable reinforcements to put in. This is the situation after an
         operation carried out by the <span class="unit">XXIXth</span> and two brigades of <span class="unit">LIInd</span> Divisions,
         which was not only successful but even more successful than we
         anticipated; wherein the initial losses on 28th June were comparatively
         small, namely 2,000, but as the result of numerous counter-attacks day
         and night, have since swelled to some 3,500.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The drafts promised in your No. 5793, A.G.2a, would, provided there
         were no more casualties, bring the units of the <span class="unit">XXIXth Division</span> to
         approximately 75 per cent. of establishment, but would leave none
         available as further reinforcements.</p>
      
      
      <p>"In view of the operations on a larger scale, with increased forces, I
         feel I should draw your attention to the risk introduced by the theatre
         of operations being so far from <span class="location">England</span>. I have no reserves in base
         depots now, while the operations we are engaged in are such that heavy
         casualties are to be expected. The want of drafts ready on the spot to
         fill up units which have suffered heavily might prevent me pressing to
         full advantage as the result of a local success. At a critical moment I
         might find myself compelled to suspend operations until the arrival of
         drafts from <span class="location">England</span>. This might involve a month and in the meantime the
         enemy would have time to consolidate his position. The difficulty of the
         drafts question is fully realized, but I think you should know exactly
         how I am placed and that I should reflect and make clear the essential
         difference between the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> and <span class="location">France</span> in so far as the necessity
         of mobilizing first reinforcements for each unit is concerned. Our real
         need is a system which will enable me to maintain drafts for the
         deficiencies in depots on my lines of communications with <span class="location">Egypt</span>."</p>
      
      
      <p>If <span class="person">K.</span> did not want brief spurts sandwiched between long waits, all he
         had to do was to tell his A.G. to see to it that the <span class="unit">XXIXth Division</span> was
         kept up to strength. A word and a frown would have done it. But he has
         not said the word, or scowled, and the troops have by extraordinary
         efforts and self-sacrifice carried through the work of strong <span class="unit">battalions</span>
         with weak ones--but only to some extent. That is the whole story.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>4th July, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. Church Parade this morning. Made a close
         inspection of the Surrey Yeomanry under  <span class="person">Major Bonsor</span>. Even with as free
         a hand as the Lord Almighty, it would be hard to invent a better type of
         fighting man than the British Yeomanry; only, they have never been
         properly appreciated by the martinets who have ruled our roost, and
         chances have never been given to them to make the most of themselves as
         soldiers.</p>
      
      
      <p>The Escort was made up of men of the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> under Lieutenant
         Burrell of the South Wales Borderers--that famous <span class="unit">battalion</span> which
         stormed so brilliantly de <span class="unit">Tott's battery</span> at the first landing,--also of
         a detachment of Australians under  <span class="person">Lieutenant Edwards</span> and a squad of New
         Zealanders under  <span class="person">Lieutenant Sheppard</span>, fine men all of them, but very
         different (despite the superficial resemblance imparted by their slouch
         hats) when thus seen shoulder to shoulder on parade. The Australians
         have the pull in height and width of chest; the New Zealanders are
         thicker all through, chests, waists, thighs.</p>
      
      
      <p>After Church Parade, boarded <span class="location">H.M.S. Basilisk</span> (Lieutenant Fallowfield)
         and steamed to <span class="location">Helles</span>. The Turks, inconsiderate as usual, were shelling
         Lancashire Landing as we got ashore. Every living soul had gone to
         ground. Strolled up the deserted road with an air of careless
         indifference, hopped casually over a huge splosh of fresh blood, and
         crossed to Hunter-Weston's Headquarters. Had I only been my simple self,
         I would have out-stripped the hare for swiftness, as it was, I, as
         C.-in-C, had to play up to the dugouts. As Hunter-Weston and I were
         starting lunch, an orderly rushed in to say that a ship in harbour had
         been torpedoed. So we rushed out with our glasses and watched. She was a
         French transport, the Carthage, and she took exactly four minutes to
         sink. The destroyers and picket boats were round her as smart as flies
         settle on a lump of sugar, and there was no loss of life. Sad to see the
         old ship go down. I knew her well at <span class="location">Malta</span> and Jean once came across in
         her from Tunis. She used to roll like the devil and was always said,
         with what justice I do not know, to be the sister ship to the Waratah
         which foundered so mysteriously somewhere off the Natal coast with a
         very good chap, a M.F.H., Percy Brown, on board. At 2.30 General
         <span class="person">Bailloud</span>, now commanding the French, came over to see me. When he had
         finished his business which he handles in so original a manner as to
         make it a recreation, I went off with Hunter-Weston and Staffs to see
         General Egerton of the <span class="unit">Lowland Division</span>. Egerton introduced me to
         Colonel Mudge, A.A.G., Major Maclean, D.A.A.G. (an old friend), Captain
         Tollemashe, G.S.O.3, and to his A.D.C., Lieutenant Laverton. We then
         went on and saw the <span class="unit">156th Brigade</span>. Passed the time of day to a lot of
         the Officers and men. Among those whose names I remember were <span class="person">Colonel Pallin</span>, acting Brigadier; <span class="person">Captain Girdwood</span>, Brigade Major; <span class="person">Captain Law</span>,
         Staff Captain; <span class="person">Colonel Peebles</span>, <span class="unit">7th Royal Scots</span>; Captain Sinclair, 4th
         Royal Scots; <span class="person">Lieutenant McClay</span>, <span class="unit">8th Scottish Rifles</span>. The last Officer
         was one of the very few--I am not sure they did not say the only one--of
         his <span class="unit">Battalion</span> who went into the assault and returned untouched.</p>
      
      
      <p>The whole Brigade had attacked H. 12 on the 28th ult. and lost a number
         of good men. The rank and file seemed very nice lads but--there was no
         mistaking it--they have been given a bad shake and many of them were
         down on their luck. As we came to each <span class="unit">Battalion</span> Headquarters we were
         told, "These are the remnants of the----," whatever the unit was. Three
         times was this remark repeated but the fourth time I had to express my
         firm opinion that in no case was the use of the word "remnant," as
         applied to a fighting unit "in being," an expression which authority
         should employ in the presence of the men.</p>
      
      
      <p>Re-embarked in <span class="location">H.M.S. unitBasiliskunit</span> and got back to <span class="location">Imbros</span> fairly late.</p>
      
      
      <p>A set of Turkish Divisional orders sent by the Turkish General to the
         Commander of their right zone at <span class="location">Helles</span> has been taken from a wounded
         Turkish officer. They bear out our views of the blow that the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> have struck at the enemy's moralunit by their brilliant attack on
         the 28th inst.</p>
      
      
      <p>"There is nothing that causes us more sorrow, increases the courage of
         the enemy and encourages him to attack more freely, causing us great
         losses, than the losing of these trenches. Henceforth, commanders who
         surrender these trenches from whatever side the attack may come before
         the last man is killed will be punished in the same way as if they had
         run away. Especially will the commanders of units told off to guard a
         certain front be punished if, instead of thinking about their work
         supporting their units and giving information to the higher command,
         they only take action after a regrettable incident has taken place.</p>
      
      
      <p>"I hope that this will not occur again. I give notice that if it does, I
         shall carry out the punishment. I do not desire to see a blot made on
         the courage of our men by those who escape from the trenches to avoid
         the rifle and machine gun fire of the enemy. Henceforth, I shall hold
         responsible all Officers who do not shoot with their revolvers all the
         privates who try to escape from the trenches on any pretext. Commander
         of the <span class="unit">11th Division</span>, Colonel Rifaat."</p>
      
      
      <p>In sending on this order to his <span class="unit">battalions</span>, the Colonel of the 127th
         Regiment adds:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"To Commander of the 1st <span class="unit">Battalion</span>. The contents will be communicated to
         the Officers and I promise to carry out the orders till the last drop of
         our blood has been shed."</p>
      
      
      <p>Then followed the signatures of the company commanders of the <span class="unit">Battalion</span>.
         There is a savage ring about these orders but they are, I am sure, more
         bracing to the recipients than laments and condolences over their
         losses.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>5th July, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. Spent a long, hot day hanging at the end of
         the wire. Heavy firing on the Peninsula last night under cover of which
         the Turks at dawn made, or tried to make, a grand, concerted attack. Not
         a soul in <span class="location">England</span>, outside the Ordnance, realizes, I believe, that
         barring the guns of the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> and the few guns of the Anzacs,
         our field artillery consists of the old 15-prs., relics of <span class="location">South Africa</span>,
         and of 5-inch hows., some of them Omdurman veterans. Quite a number of
         these guns are already unserviceable and, in the <span class="unit">42nd Division</span>, to keep
         one and a half batteries fully gunned, we have had to use up every piece
         in the Brigade. The surplus personnel are thus wasted. To take on new
         Skoda or Krupp guns with these short-range veterans is rough on the
         gunners. Still, but for the Territorial Force we should have nothing at
         all, and but for those guns to-day some of the enemy might have got
         home.</p>
      
      
      <p>A sort of professional gossip turned up to-day from G.H.Q. <span class="location">France</span>. We do
         not seem to be so popular as we deserve to be in unitla belle <span class="location">France</span>!unit But
         what I would plead were I only able to get at <span class="person">Joffre</span> and French is that
         we are "such a little one." Were we all to be set down in the West
         to-morrow with our shattered, torn formations, they'd put us back into
         reserve for a month's rest and training. As for the guns, they'd scrap
         the lot. unitTheyunit don't want ancient 15-prs. and 5-inch hows. out there.
         They picture us feasting upon their munitions, but half of what we use
         they would not touch with a barge pole and, of the good stuff, one
         Division in <span class="location">France</span> will fire away in one day what would serve to take
         the Peninsula.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person"> Braithwaite</span> has a letter from the D.M.I. telling him that 5,000 Russians
         sailed from Vladivostock on the 1st inst. to join us here. One Regiment
         of four <span class="unit">Battalions</span> plus one Sotnia of Cossacks. A reinforcement of 5,000
         stout soldiers tumbling out of the skies! Russians placed here are worth
         twice their number elsewhere, not only because we need rifles so badly,
         but because of the moral effect their presence should have in the
         Balkans.</p>
      
      
      <p>This little vodka pick-me-up has come in the nick of time to hearten me
         against the tenor of the news of to-day which is splendid indeed in one
         sense; ominous in another. The Turks are being heavily reinforced. All
         the enemy troops who made the big attack last night were fresh arrivals
         from <span class="location">Adrianople</span>. I do not grumble at the attack (on the contrary we like
         it), but at the reason they had for making it, which is that two fresh
         Divisions, newly arrived, asked leave to show their muscle by driving us
         into the sea. Full details are only just in. The biggest bombardment
         took place at Anzac. A Turkish battleship joined in from the <span class="location">Helles</span>pont,
         dropping about twenty 11.2-inch shells into our lines. At <span class="location">Helles</span>, all
         night, the Turks blazed away from their trenches. At 4 a.m. they opened
         fire on our trenches and beaches with every gun they could bring to
         bear from Asia or Achi Baba. Their Asiatic Batteries alone fired 1,900
         rounds, of which 700 fell on Lancashire Landing. At least 5,000 shell
         were loosed off on to <span class="location">Helles</span>. A lot of the stuff was 6-inch and over.
         The bombardment was very wild and seemed almost unaimed. Soon after 4
         a.m. very heavy columns of Turks tried to emerge from the Ravine against
         the left of the <span class="unit">29th Division</span>. "It wanted to be the hell of a great
         attack," as one of the witnesses, a moderate spoken young gentleman,
         states. When the Commanders saw what was impending they sent messages to
         <span class="person">Simpson-Baikie</span> begging him to send some 4.5 H.E. shell into the Ravine
         which was beginning to overflow. He was adamant. He had only a few
         rounds of H.E. and he would not spend them, feeling sure his 18 prs.
         with their shrapnel were masters of the field. At 6 a.m. out came the
         Turks, not in lines, but just like a swarm of bees. Our fellows never
         saw the like and began to wonder whenever they were going to stop, and
         what on earth could stop them! Thousands of Turks in a bunch, so the
         boys say, swarmed out of their trenches and the <span class="location">Gully Ravine</span>. Well, they
         were stopped unitdeadunit. There they lie, unitstillunit. The guns ate the life out
         of them.</p>
      
      
      <p>It was our central group of artillery who did it. As that big oblong
         crowd of Turks showed their left flank to Baikie's nine batteries they
         were swept in enfilade by shrapnel. The fall of the shell was corrected
         by the two young R.A. subalterns at the front, neither of whom would
         observe in the usual way through his periscope. They looked over the
         parapet because that method was more sure and quick, and the stress of
         the battle was great. There is a rumour that both were shot through the
         head: I pray it may be but a rumour. Out of all these Turks some thirty
         only reached our parapets. The sudden destruction which befell them was
         due in the main to the devotion of these two young heroes. At 7.30 a.m.
         the Turks tried to storm again. Some of them got in amongst the <span class="unit">Royal Naval Division</span>, who brought up their own supports and killed 300,
         driving out the rest. Ninety dead Turks are laid out on their parapet.
         Another, later, enemy effort against the right of the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> was
         clean wiped out. 150 Turks are dead there. But it is on the far
         crestline they lie thick.</p>
      
      
      <p>Every one of these attacking Turks were unitfreshunit--from <span class="location">Adrianople</span>! Full
         of fight as compared with their thrice beaten brethren. If the Turks are
         given time to swap troops in the middle of fighting, we can't really
         tell how we stand. Still; they are not now as fresh as they were. They
         have lost a terrible lot of men since the 28th. The big Ravine and all
         the small nullahs are chock-a-block with corpses. Their casualties in
         these past few days are put at very high figures by both <span class="person">Birdie</span> and H.W.
         and it is probable that 5,000 are actually lying dead on the ground. I
         have on my table a statement made by <span class="person">de Lisle</span>; endorsed by <span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span>
         and dated 4th instant, saying that 1,200 Turkish dead can be counted
         corpse by corpse from the left front. The actual numbers <span class="person">de Lisle</span>
         estimates as between 2,000 and 3,000. Now we have to-day's losses to
         throw in. The Turks are burning their candle fast at the Anzac as well
         as the <span class="location">Helles</span> end. Ten days of this and they are finished.[25]</p>
      
      
      <p>Naturally, my mind dwells happily just now upon our incoming New Army
         formations. Yet every now and then I feel compelled to look back to
         regret the lack of systematic flow of drafts and munitions which have
         turned our fine victory of the 28th into a pyrrhic instead of a fruitful
         affair. When <span class="person">Pyrrhus</span> gained his battle over the Romans and exclaimed,
         "One more such victory and I am done in," or words to that effect, he
         had no organized system of depots behind him from which the bloody gaps
         in his ranks could be filled. A couple of thousand years have now passed
         and we are still as unscientific as <span class="person">Pyrrhus</span>. A splendid expeditionary
         force sails away; invades an Empire, storms the outworks and in doing so
         knocks itself to bits. Then a second expeditionary force is sent, but
         that would have been unnecessary had any sort of arrangement been
         thought out for promptly replacing first wastages in men and in shell.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>6th July, 1915. From early morning till 5 p.m. stuck as persistently
         to my desk as the flies stuck persistently to me. After tea went riding
         with <span class="person">Maitland</span>. Then with  <span class="person">Pollen</span> to dine on board <span class="location">H.M.S. Triad</span>. The two
         Territorial Divisions are coming. What with them and the Rooskies we
         ought to get a move on this time. Discoursed small craft with the
         Admiral. The French hate the overseas fire--small blame to them--and
         <span class="person">Bailloud</span> agrees with his predecessor<span class="person"> Gouraud</span> in thinking that one man
         hit in the back from Asia affects the moralunit of his comrades as badly
         as half a dozen bowled over by the enemy facing them. The Admiral's idea
         of landing from <span class="location">Tenedos</span> would help us here, but it is admitted on all
         hands now that the Turks have pushed on with their Asiatic defences, and
         it is too much to ask of either the New Army or of the Territorials that
         they should start off with a terrible landing.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>7th July, 1915. No escape from the steadily rising flood of letters
         and files,--none from the swarms of filthy flies. General <span class="person">Bailloud</span> and
         Colonel <span class="person">Piepape</span> (Chief of Staff) came across with Major Bertier in a
         French torpedo boat to see me. They stayed about an hour. <span class="person">Bailloud</span>'s
         main object was to get me to put off the attack planned by General
         Gouraud for to-morrow.<span class="person"> Gouraud</span> has worked out everything, and I greatly
         hoped in the then state of the Turks the French would have done a very
         good advance on our right. The arrival of these fresh Turkish Divisions
         from <span class="location">Adrianople</span> does make a difference. Still, I am sorry the attack is
         not to come off. <span class="person">Girodon</span> is a heavy loss to <span class="person">Bailloud</span>. <span class="person">Piepape</span> has never
         been a General Staff Officer before; by training, bent of mind and
         experience he is an administrator. He is very much depressed by the loss
         of the 2,000 quarts of wine by the Asiatic shell. Since<span class="person"> Gouraud</span> and
         <span class="person">Girodon</span> have left them the French seem to be less confident. When
         <span class="person">Bailloud</span> entered our Mess he said, in the presence of four or five young
         Officers, "If the Asiatic side of the Straits is not held by us within
         fifteen days our whole force is voue a la destruction." He meant it as
         a jest, but when those who prophesy destruction are unitgros bonnetsunit; big
         wigs; it needs no miracle to make them come off--I don't mean the wigs
         but the prophecies. Fortunately, <span class="person">Bailloud</span> soon made a cheerier class of
         joke and wound up by inviting me to dine with him in an extra chic
         restaurant at <span class="location">Constantinople</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have told <span class="person">K.</span> plainly that the employment of an ordinary executive
         soldier as Boss of so gigantic a business as <span class="person">Mudros</span> is suicidal--no
         less. Heaven knows <span class="person">K.</span> himself had his work cut out when he ran the
         communications during his advance upon Khartoum. Heaven knows I myself
         had a hard enough job when I became responsible for feeding our troops
         at Chitral, two hundred miles into the heart of the Himalayas from the
         base at Nowshera. Breaking bulk at every stage--it was heart-breaking.
         First the railway, then the bullock cart, the camel, the mules--till, at
         the Larram Pass we got down to the donkey. But here we have to break
         bulk from big ships to small craft; to send our stuff not to one but to
         several landings, to run the show with a mixed staff of Naval and
         Military Officers. No, give me deserts or precipices,--anything fixed
         and solid is better than this capricious, ever-changing sea. The problem
         is a real puzzler, demanding experience, energy, good temper as well as
         the power of entering into the point of view of sailors as well as
         soldiers, and of being (mentally) in at least three places at once:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"unitFrom General Sir  <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span> to  <span class="person">Earl Kitchener</span>. (No. M.F. 424).</p>
      
      
      <p>"Private. I am becoming seriously apprehensive about my Lines of
         Communication and am forced to let you know the state of affairs.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Much of the time of General Headquarters has been taken up during the
         last few days considering matters relating to <span class="person">Mudros</span> and Lines of
         Communication generally. The Inspector-General of Communications must be
         a man of energy and ideas. The new Divisions will find the <span class="person">Mudrosunitlittoral</span>
         on arrival better prepared for their reception than it was a
         month ago. The present man is probably excellent in his own line, but he
         himself in writing doubts his own ability to cope with one of the most
         complicated situations imaginable. Please do not think for a moment that
         I am still hankering after <span class="person">Ellison</span>, I only want a man of that type,
         someone, for instance, like <span class="person">Maxwell</span> or Sir Edward Ward. Unless I can
         feel confident in the Commandant of my Lines of Communication I shall
         always be looking behind me. <span class="person">Wallace</span> could remain as Deputy
         Inspector-General of Communications. Something, however, must be done
         meanwhile, and I am sending Brigadier-General Hon. <span class="person">H.A. Lawrence</span>, a man
         of tried business capacity and great character, to <span class="person">Mudros</span> to-day as
         dry-nurse."</p>
      
      
      <p>I have followed up this cable in my letter to Lord <span class="person">K.</span> of date, where I
         say, "I have just seen  <span class="person">Bertie Lawrence</span> who I am sending to reinforce
         <span class="person">Wallace</span>. He is bitterly disappointed at losing his Brigade, but there is
         no help for it. He is a business man of great competence, and I think he
         ought to be able to do much to get things on to a ship-shape footing.
         General <span class="person">Douglas</span> is very sorry too and says that Lawrence was one of the
         best Brigadiers imaginable."</p>
      
      
      <p>The last sentence has been written, I confess, with a spice of malice.
         When, about a month ago, I had hurriedly to lay my hands on a Commander
         for the <span class="unit">127th Brigade</span>, I bethought me of  <span class="person">Bertie Lawrence</span>, then G.S.O. to
         the Yeomanry in <span class="location">Egypt</span>. The thrust of a Lancer and the circumspection of
         a Banker do not usually harbour in the same skull, but I believed I knew
         of one exception. So I put Lawrence in. By return King's Messenger came
         a rap over the knuckles. To promote a dugout to be a Brigadier of
         <span class="unit">Infantry</span> was risky, but to put in a Cavalry dugout as a Brigadier of
         <span class="unit">Infantry</span> was outrageous! Still, I stuck to Lorenzo, and lo and behold!
         <span class="person">Douglas</span>, the Commander of the East Lancs. Division, is fighting tooth
         and nail for his paragon Brigadier![26]</p>
      
      
      <p>Since 19th March we have been asking for bombs--any kind of bombs--and
         we have not even got answers. Now they offer us some speciality bombs
         for which <span class="location">France</span>, they say, has no use.</p>
      
      
      <p>I have replied:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"I shall be most grateful for as many bombs of this and any other kind
         as you can spare. Anything made of iron and containing high explosive
         and detonator will be welcome. I should be greatly relieved if a large
         supply could be sent overland via Marseilles, as the bomb question is
         growing increasingly urgent. The Turks have an unlimited supply of
         bombs, and our deficiencies place our troops at a disadvantage both
         physically and morally and increase our difficulties in holding captured
         trenches.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Could you arrange for a weekly consignment of 10,000 to be sent to us
         regularly?"</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">De Lisle</span> came over to dine and stay the night.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>8th July, 1915. <span class="location">H.M.S. "Triad."</span> <span class="location">Tenedos</span>. Started off in <span class="location">H.M.S. Triad</span>
         with <span class="person">Freddie Maitland</span>, <span class="person">Aspinall</span> and our host, the Admiral.</p>
      
      
      <p>Had a lovely sail to <span class="location">Tenedos</span> where Colonel Nuillion (acting Governor)
         and Commander Samson, now Commandant of the Flying Camp, came on board.
         After lunch, rowed ashore. There was some surf on and I jumped short,
         landing (if such an expression may pass) in the sea. Wet feet rather
         refreshing than otherwise on so hot a day. <span class="location">Tenedos</span> is lovely. Each of
         these islands has its own type of coasts, vegetation and colouring: like
         rubies and diamonds they are connected yet hardly akin. Climbed <span class="location">Tenedos</span>
         Hill, our ascent ending in a desperate race for the crest. My long legs
         and light body enabled me to win despite the weight of age. Very hot,
         though, and the weight of age has got even less now.</p>
      
      
      <p>From the top we had an hour's close prospecting of the opposite coasts,
         where the Turks have done too much digging to make landing anything but
         a very bloody business. Half a mile to the South looks healthier, but
         they are sure to have a lot of machine guns there now. The landing would
         be worse than on the 25th April. Anyway, unitI am not going to do itunit.</p>
      
      
      <p>On the ground we now have a fair showing of aeroplanes, but mostly of
         the wingless sort. At this precise moment only two are really fit. <span class="person">K.</span>
         has stuck to his word and is not going to help us here, and I can't
         grumble as certainly I was forewarned. Had he only followed <span class="person">Neville
            Usborne's</span> L10,000,000 suggestion, we might now be bombing the Turks'
         landing places and store depots, as well as spotting every day for our
         gunners. But these naval airmen, bold fellows, always on for an
         adventurous attack, are hardly in their element when carrying out the
         technical gunnery part of our work.</p>
      
      
      <p>Re-embarked, and during our sail back saw a trawler firing at a
         submarine, whilst other trawlers and picket boats were skurrying up from
         all points of the compass. Nets were run out in a jiffy, but I fear the
         big fish had already given them the slip. Cast anchor about 7 o'clock.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Colonel Dick</span> and <span class="person">Mr. Graives</span> dined.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>9th July, 1915. Spent the morning writing for the King's Messenger. My
         letter to <span class="person">K.</span> (an answer to that of Fitz to me) tells him:--</p>
      
      
      <p>(1) That we have passed through the most promising week since the first
         landing. The thousand yards' advance on the left and the rows of dead
         Turks left by the receding tide of their counter-attack are solid
         evidences to the results of the 28th ult., and of the six very heavy
         Turkish assaults which have since broken themselves to pieces against
         us.</p>
      
      
      <p>(2) That<span class="person"> Gouraud's</span> loss almost wipes out our gains. <span class="person">Bailloud</span> does not
         attack till next week when he hopes to have more men and more
         ammunition, but will this help us so much if the Turks also have more
         men and more ammunition?</p>
      
      
      <p>(3) That the Asiatic guns are giving us worry, but that I hope to knock
         them out with our own heavy guns (the French 9.4s and our own 9.2s) just
         being mounted. When the new Monitors come they ought to help us here.</p>
      
      
      <p>(4) That "unitpower of digestion, sleeping and nerve power are what are
         essential above all things to anyone who would command successfully at
         the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>. Compared with these qualifications most others are
         secondary."</p>
      
      
      <p>(5) That the British and Australians are marvels of endurance, but that
         I am having to pull the Indian Brigade right out and send them to
         <span class="location">Imbros</span>. Their Commander, fine soldier though he be, is too old for the
         post of Brigadier; he ought to be commanding a Division; and the men are
         morally and physically tired and have lost three-fourths of their
         officers: with rest they will all of them come round.</p>
      
      
      <p>(6) That <span class="person">Baldwin's</span> Brigade of the <span class="unit">13th Division</span> have been landed on the
         Peninsula and are now mixed up by platoons with the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> where
         they are tumbling to their new conditions quite quickly. They have
         already created a very good impression at <span class="location">Helles</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Godley and his New Zealander A.D.C. (Lieutenant Rhodes), both old
         friends, came over from <span class="location">H.M.S. Triad</span> to lunch. Hunter-Weston crossed
         from <span class="location">Helles</span> to dine and stay the night.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>10th July, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>. These <span class="location">Imbros</span> flies actually drink my fountain
         pen dry! Hunter-Weston left for <span class="location">Helles</span> in the evening.</p>
      
      
      <p>Yesterday a cable saying there were no men left in <span class="location">England</span> to fill
         either the <span class="unit">42nd Division</span> or the 52nd. We have already heard that the
         Naval Division must fade away. Poor old Territorials! The War Office are
         behaving like an architect who tries to mend shaky foundations by
         clapping on another storey to the top of the building. Once upon a time
         President Lincoln and the Federal States let their matured units starve
         and thought to balance the account by the dispatch of untried
         formations. Why go on making these assurances to the B.P. that we have
         as many men coming in voluntarily as we can use?</p>
      
      
      <p>Have refused the request made by His Excellency, <span class="person">Weber Pasha</span>, who signs
         himself Commandant of the Ottoman Forces, to have a five hours' truce
         for burying their piles of dead. The British Officers who have been out
         to meet the Turkish parlementaires say that the sight of the Turkish
         dead lying in thousands just over the crestline where Baikie's guns
         caught them on the 5th inst. is indeed an astonishing sight. Our
         Intelligence are clear that the reason the Turks make this request is
         that they cannot get their men to charge over the corpses of their
         comrades. Dead Turks are better than barbed wire and so, though on
         grounds of humanity as well as health, I should like the poor chaps to
         be decently buried, I find myself forced to say no.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Patrick Shaw Stewart</span> came to see me. I made <span class="person">Peter</span> take his photo. He was
         on a rat of a pony and sported a long red beard. How his lady friends
         would laugh!</p>

      <p>CHAPTER XIII K.'S ADVICE AND THE P.M.'S ENVOY</p>
      
      
      <p> 11th July, 1915.  Worked in my office from early morning till 12.45.
         The whole scheme for to-morrow's attack is cut and dried, according to
         our cloth: time tables fixed and every round counted.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Freddy Stopford</span> and his Staff turned up from <span class="location">Mudros</span>. <span class="person">Stopford</span> in very
         good form. The first thing he did was to deliver himself of a personal
         message from <span class="person">Lord K.</span> He (<span class="person">Stopford</span>) wrote it down, in the ante-room, the
         moment he left the presence and I may take it as being as good as
         verbatim. Here it is:--</p>
      
      
      <p>     "<span class="person">Lord Kitchener</span> told me to tell you he had no wish to interfere
         with the man on the spot, but from closely watching our actions
         here, as well as those of <span class="person">General French</span> in <span class="location">Flanders</span>, he is certain
         that the only way to make a real success of an attack is by
         surprise. Also, that when the surprise ceases to be operative, in
         so far that the advance is checked and the enemy begin to collect
         from all sides to oppose the attackers, then, perseverance becomes
         merely a useless waste of life. In every attack there seems to be a
         moment when success is in the assailant's grasp. Both the French
         and ourselves at <span class="location">Arras</span> and <span class="location">Neuve Chapelle</span> lost the opportunity."</p>
      
      
      <p>Well said! <span class="person">K.</span> has made <span class="person">Stopford</span> bring me in his pocket the very text for
         what I wanted to say to him. Only my grumbling thoughts find expression
         by my pen but I have plenty of others and my heart has its warm corner
         for <span class="person">K.</span> whenever he cares to come in.</p>
      
      
      <p>As I told <span class="person">Stopford</span>, <span class="person">K.</span> has not only anticipated my advice but has dived
         right down into this muddle of twentieth century war and finds lying at
         the bottom of it only the old original idea of war in the year 1. At our
         first landing the way was open to us for just so long as the  surprise 
         to the Turks lasted. That period here, at the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>, might be
         taken as being perhaps twice as long as it would be on the Western front
         which gave us a great pull. The reason was that land communications were
         bad and our troops on the sea could move thrice as fast as the Turks on
         their one or two bad roads. Yet, even so, there was no margin for
         dawdling. <span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span> and <span class="person">d'Amade</span> had tried their best to use their
         brief  surprise  breathing space in seizing the Key to the opening of
         the Narrows--<span class="location">Achi Baba</span>, and had failed through lack of small craft, lack
         of water, lack of means of bringing up supplies, lack of our 10 per
         cent. reserves to fill casualties. At that crucial moment when we had
         beaten the local enemy troops and the enemy reinforcements had not yet
         come up, we could not get the men or the stuff quick enough to shore.
         Still, we had gained three or four miles and there were spots on the
         Peninsula where, to-day, three or four miles would be enough. Also,
         supposing he had to run a landing, his (<span class="person">Stopford</span>'s) action would take
         place under much easier conditions than <span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span>'s on April 25th.</p>
      
      
      <p>First and foremost, in our "beetles" or barges, conveying 500 men under
         their own engines, we had an instrument which reduced the physical
         effort three quarters. This meant half the battle. When we made our
         original landing at Anzac we could only put 1,500 men ashore, per trip,
         at a speed of 2-1/2 miles per hour, in open cutters. Were a Commander to
         repeat that landing now, he would be able to run 5,000 men ashore, per
         trip, at a speed of five miles per hour with no trouble about oars,
         tows, etc., and with protection against shrapnel and rifle bullets. As
         to the actual landing on the beach, that could be done--we had proved
         it--in less than one quarter of the time. Each beetle had a "brow" fixed
         on to her bows; a thing to be let down like a drawbridge over which the
         men could pour ashore by fours; the same with mules, guns, supplies,
         they could all be rushed on land as fast as they could be handled on the
         beaches. Secondly, we had already been for some time at work to fix up
         the wherewithal to meet our chronic nightmare, the water trouble.
         Thirdly, the system of bringing up food and ammunition from the beaches
         to the firing line had now been practically worked out into a science at
         <span class="location">Helles</span> and Anzac where <span class="person">Stopford</span> would be given a chance of studying it
         at first hand.</p>
      
      
      <p>As to place, date, command, and distribution of forces, these were still
         being considered; still undetermined; and I could say no more at
         present. <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> was away at <span class="location">Helles</span> but, if he would go over to the
         General Staff, he would find <span class="person">Aspinall</span>, my G.S. (1), and the Q. Staff who
         would give him the hang of our methods and post him in matters which
         would be applicable to any date or place.</p>
      
      
      <p>There was more in this message as taken down by <span class="person">Stopford</span>. After going
         into some details of trench warfare, <span class="person">K.</span>'s message went on:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"It is not the wish of the Cabinet that <span class="person">Sir Ian Hamilton</span> should make
         partial attacks. They (the Cabinet) consider it preferable that he
         should await the arrival of his reinforcements to make one great effort,
         which, if successful, will give them the ridge commanding the Narrows.
         It is not intended, however, that Sir Ian should do nothing in the
         meantime and if he gets a really good opportunity he is to seize it."</p>
      
      
      <p>There is something in this reminds me of Kuropatkin's orders to
         Stakelberg, yet I am glad to find that our spontaneously generated
         scheme jumps with the views of the Cabinet, for, there is only one
         "ridge commanding the Narrows" (Kilid Bahr is a plateau), and it is that
         ridge we mean to try for by "one great effort."</p>
      
      
      <p>In my reply I shall merely acknowledge. Sari Bair is my secret; my Open
         Sesame to the cave where the forty thieves of the Committee of Union
         and Progress have their Headquarters. It makes me uneasy to think the
         Cabinet are talking about Sari Bair.</p>
      
      
      <p>A battle is a swirl of "ifs" and "ands." The Commander who enters upon
         it possessed by some just and clear principle is like a sailing ship
         entering a typhoon on the right tack. After that he lives from hand to
         mouth. How far will wise saws cut ice? How much nearer do you get to
         shooting a snipe by being  told  how not to take your aim? Well thought
         out plans and preparations deserve to win; order and punctuality on the
         part of subordinates tend to make the reality correspond to the General
         Staff conception; surprise, if the Commander can bring it off, is worth
         all <span class="person">K.</span> can say of it; the energy and rapidity of the chosen troops will
         exploit that surprise for its full value--bar, always, Luck--the Joker;
         and Wish to Fight and Will to Win are the surest victory getters in the
         pack. The more these factors are examined, the more sure it is that
         everything must in the last resort depend upon the  executive 
         Commander; and here, of course, I am referring to an  enterprise , not
         to a huge, mechanically organized dead-lock like the western front.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Stopford</span> was away in G.H.Q. Staff tents all afternoon; afterwards both
         he and Adderley, his A.D.C., dined. <span class="person">Stopford</span> likes Reed who is, indeed,
         a very pleasant fellow to work with. Still, I stick to what I wrote
         Wolfe <span class="person">Murray</span>:--the  combination  of <span class="person">Stopford</span> and Reed is not good; not
         for this sort of job.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 12th July, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Had meant to start for <span class="location">Helles</span> an hour before
         daylight to witness the opening of the attack by the French Corps and
         the Lowland Division. But am too bad with the universal complaint to
         venture many yards from camp.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Stopford</span> and Staff breakfasted. He has fallen in love with our ideas.
         After lunch he and his party left for <span class="location">Mudros</span>. Am forcing myself to write
         so as to ease the strain of waiting: the battle is going on: backwards
         and forwards--backwards and forwards--I travel between my tent; the
         signal station, and the G.S. map tent.</p>
      
      
      <p>A delightful message from <span class="person">K.</span>, thanking me for my letters: patting me on
         the back; telling me that <span class="person">Altham</span> is coming out to run the
         communications, and <span class="person">Ellison</span> to serve on my Staff.</p>
      
      
      <p>Thank heavens we are at last to have a business man at the head of our
         business! As to <span class="person">Ellison</span>, <span class="person">K.</span>'s conscience has for long been smiting him
         for not having let me take my own C.G.S. with me in the first instance.
         But <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> has won his spurs now in many a hair-raising crisis, so
         <span class="person">K.</span> may let his mind rest at ease.</p>
      
      
      <p>Freddie <span class="person">Maitland</span> and I dined with the Vice-Admiral who kept a signaller
         on special watch for my messages from the shore--but nothing came in.
         He, the Admiral, wants to take all the 600 stokers serving in the Royal
         Naval Division back to the ships. This will be the last straw to the
         Division. We had the treat of being taken off the  Triad  in the
         Admiral's racing motor boat and when we got ashore found good news which
         I have just cabled home:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"In the southern section we attacked at daylight to-day with our right
         and right centre. After heavy fighting lasting all day the troops
         engaged, namely, the French Corps and the LIInd Lowland Division, have
         succeeded in carrying the two strongly held and fortified lines of
         Turkish trenches opposite to them. The ground covered by the advance
         varies in depth from 200 to 400 yards, and if we can maintain our gains
         against to-night's counter-attacks the effect of the action will be not
         only to advance but greatly to strengthen our line. Full details
         to-morrow."</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 13th July, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Still feeling very slack. Nothing clear from
         <span class="location">Helles</span>. My cable best explains:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"Troops have been continuously engaged since my last cable, but
         situation is still too confused to admit of definition, especially as
         telephone wires all cut by shell or rifle fire.</p>
      
      
      <p>"So far as can be gathered the sum total of the engagements taking place
         in a labyrinth of trenches is satisfactory up to the hour of cabling and
         we have taken some 200 prisoners. I hope I shall be able to send
         definite news to-morrow morning."</p>
      
      
      <p>Oh, energy, to what distant clime have you flown? I used to be
         energetic; not perhaps according to Evelyn Wood's standards--but
         still--energetic! Yet, see me to-day, when a poor cousin to the
         cholera--this cursed enteritis--lays me by the heels; fills me with
         desperate longing to lie down and do nothing but rest. More than half my
         Staff and troops are in the same state of indescribable slackness and
         this, I think, must be the reason the Greeks were ten long years taking
         Troy.</p>
      
      
      <p>Some newspaper correspondents have arrived. I have told them they may do
         whatever they d--d well please. <span class="person">Ashmead-Bartlett</span> is vexed at his
         monopoly being spoiled. Charlie Burn, who came with the King's bag,
         lunched. The Vice-Admiral, Roger <span class="person">Keyes</span>, and Flag-Lieutenant Bowlby
         dined; very good of them to leave their own perfectly appointed table
         for our rough and ready fare. The A.D.C.s between them managed to get
         some partridges, opulent birds which lent quite a Ritzian tone to our
         banquet.</p>
      
      
      <p>As was expected, the Turks counter-attacked heavily last night but were
         unable to drive us out except in one small section on our right. To-day,
         fighting is still going on and the Naval Division are in it now. We have
         made a good gain and taken over 400 prisoners and a machine gun. We are
         still on the rack, though, as there are a lot of Turks not yet cleared
         out from holes and corners of our new holding, and ammunition is running
         very short. If our ammunition does not run out altogether and we can
         hold what we have, our total gain will be 500 yards depth.</p>
      
      
      <p>Since June 4th, when we had to whang off the whole of our priceless 600
         rounds of H.E., we have had  none  for 18-prs. on the Peninsula--not one
         solitary demnition round; nor do we seem in the least likely to get one
         solitary demnition round. <span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span> and his C.R.A. explain forcibly,
         not to say explosively, that on the 28th June the right attack would
         have scored a success equally brilliant to that achieved by the <span class="unit">29th</span>
         Division on our left, had we been able to allot as many shell to the
         Turkish trenches assaulted by the <span class="unit">156th Brigade</span>--Lowland Division--as we
         did to the sector by the sea. But we could not, because, once we had
         given a fair quota to the left, there was not enough stuff in our
         lockers for the right. Such is war! No use splitting the difference and
         trying to win everywhere like high brows halting between <span class="location">Flanders</span> and
         <span class="location">Gallipoli</span>. But I  am  sick at heart, I must say, to think my brother
         Scots should have had to catch hold of the hot end of the poker. Also to
         think that, with another couple of hundred rounds, we should have got
         and held H. 12. H. 12 which dominates--so prisoners say--the wells
         whence the enemy draws water for the whole of his right wing.</p>
      
      
      <p>To-day the old trouble is a-foot once again. <span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span> tells us the
         Turkish counter-attacks are being pressed with utmost fury and are
         beginning to look ugly, as we can give our infantry no support from our
         guns although the enemy offer excellent artillery targets. When <span class="person">K.</span> is
         extra accommodating it is doubly hard to be importunate, but it's got to
         be done:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p> General <span class="person">Sir Ian Hamilton</span> to Earl Kitchener. </p>
      
      
      <p>"With reference to my telegrams No. M.F. 328 of 13th June and No. M.F.
         381 of 28th June. Each successive fight shows more clearly than the last
         how much may hang on an ample supply of ammunition, more especially high
         explosive howitzer ammunition. In my telegram No. M.F. 381 I said that I
         hoped we might be able to achieve success with the ammunition already
         promised, and I adhere to that opinion; but every additional 100 rounds
         means some reduction of risks and greater assurance of success. I raise
         this question again because I gather from what I hear that matters in
         the other theatre of operations may possibly be at a standstill without
         much prospect of any vital alteration before the autumn fairly sets in.
         If this should be the case it is for you to consider whether a larger
         and more regular supply of ammunition should be sent to me in order to
         give this force the utmost chance of gaining an early success. Judging
         from the increased effect of the bombardments before the last two
         attacks on facilitating the Infantry advance I am led to hope that this
         success would not be long delayed under the cumulative effect of
         unremitting bombardment. If, therefore, any change in the general
         situation should make it possible to allow me temporary preferential
         claim to all the ammunition I should like, I would ask for the following
         amounts to be here by 1st August, in addition to those accompanying the
         troops and already promised, namely, 4.5-inch howitzer, 3,000 rounds;
         5-inch howitzer, 7,000 rounds; 6-inch howitzer, 5,000, and 9.3-inch
         howitzer, 500 rounds, all high explosive. I should also ask for a
         monthly supply on the following scale, first consignment to arrive
         before 15th August:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  "18-pr.               300,000
         "4.5-inch howitzer     30,000
         "5-inch howitzer       30,000
         "6-inch howitzer       24,000
         "60-pr.                15,000
         "9.2-inch howitzer      6,000</p>
      
      
      <p>"The howitzer ammunition to be all high explosive, the 60-pr. to be
         one-third shrapnel and two-thirds high explosive, and the 18-pr. to be
         half of each.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The above monthly scale includes ammunition for the following
         additional ordnance which I should like to get, namely, two batteries of
         4.5-inch howitzers for each of the Xth and XIth Divisions (since 5-inch
         howitzers are found to be too inaccurate to bombard the enemy trenches
         even in close proximity to our own), one battery of 6-inch howitzers and
         four 9.2-inch howitzers.</p>
      
      
      <p>"On the assumption already made it might be possible for you to arrange
         to forward to Ordnance Stores, Marseilles, the ammunition asked for to
         be here by 1st August. Time would thus be gained to accumulate the
         supply required, and I could arrange with the Vice-Admiral to send a
         fast steamer of 1,000 tons hold capacity to bring the consignment of
         high explosives from Marseilles. To get the steamer coaled, to arrive at
         Marseilles, coal again and be ready to receive the ammunition, would
         take seven days.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Please understand that this suggestion is only prompted for the
         following reasons: (1) My growing belief that ample artillery might,
         within a limited period, lead to quite a considerable success in this
         theatre, and (2) because the reports which reach me seem to indicate
         that an offensive is not likely to be undertaken elsewhere at present
         (and I have mainly asked for offensive ammunition).</p>
      
      
      <p>"The monthly supply above detailed I should not expect would be required
         for more than two months."</p>
      
      
      <p>If our Government really--whole-heartedly-- will  that there should be a
         complete success in the East, they must, equally, with whole hearts and
         braced-up  will , resist (for a while) the idea of any offensive in the
         West. In saying this I speak of the A.B.C. of war. The main theatre is
         where the amphibious power wishes to make it so. This cable of mine sent
         to a man like <span class="person">Lord K.</span> is a very strong order. But now is the time to
         speak up and let him realize that he must let the fields of France lie
         fallow for the summer if he wishes to plough the Black Sea waves in
         autumn.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 14th July, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Wrote letters in the morning, and in the
         evening went for a ride to the Salt Lake and there inspected the new
         aeroplane camp on the far side of the water.</p>
      
      
      <p>Last night more counter-attacks, all driven off. The French right is now
         actually on the mouth of the Kereves Dere where it runs into the sea. We
         have made about 500 prisoners and have captured a machine gun.
         <span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span> had to transfer the command of the <span class="unit">52nd Division</span>,
         temporarily, to Shaw, the new Commander of the <span class="unit">13th Division</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Baikie is crying out to us for shells as if  we  were bottling them up!
         There are none.</p>
      
      
      <p>
         15th July, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> The answer has come in from the War
         Office:--the answer, I mean, to mine of the day before yesterday in
         which it is suggested that  if  our rich brethren were off their feed
         for the moment, some crumbs of high explosive might be spared:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"We have great difficulty in sending you the amounts of ammunition
         mentioned in our No. 5770, cipher, and even now the proportion of 18-pr.
         high explosive will be less than stated therein. In response, however,
         to your No. M.F. 444, we are adding 1,000 rounds 4.5-inch, 500--5-inch,
         500--6-inch and 75--9.2-inch. It will be quite impossible to continue to
         send you ammunition at this rate, as we have reduced the supply to
         France in order to send what we have to you, and the amounts asked for
         in the second part of your telegram could not be spared without stopping
         all operations in France. This, of course, is out of the question."</p>
      
      
      <p>"This, of course, is out of the question." "Stopping all operations in
         France" is the very kernel of the question. If half the things we hear
         about the Bosche forces and our own are half true, we have no prospect
         of dealing any decisive blow in the West till next spring. And an
         indecisive blow is worse than no blow. But we can  hold on  there till
         all's blue. Now H.E. is offensive and shrapnel is defensive. I ought to
         attack at once; French mustn't. Therefore, we should be given,  now ,
         dollops of H.E.</p>
      
      
      <p>This talk does not come through my hat. Some of the best brains on the
         Western field are in touch with those of some of my following here. The
         winning post stares us in the face; my old Chief gallops off the course;
         how can I resist calling out? And then I get this "of course" cable (not
         written by <span class="person">K.</span> I feel sure) which shows, if it shows anything, that "of
         course" we ought never to have come here at all! Simple, is it not? In
         war all is simple--that's why it's so complex. Never mind; my cable has
         not been wasted. We reckon the 1,100 extra rounds it has produced may
         save us 100 British casualties.</p>
      
      
      <p>Rode over to "K" Beach and inspected the 25th Casualty Clearing Station,
         Commandant Lieutenant-Colonel Mackenzie. Walked through the different
         hospital wards talking to some twenty officers and two hundred men;
         mostly medical cases. Did not think things at all up to the mark. Made
         special note of the lack of mosquito nets, beds, pyjamas and other
         comforts. For weeks past Jean has been toiling to get mosquito nets
         bought and made up, which was simple, and to get them out to us, which
         seems impossible. Too bad when so much money is being spent to see men
         lying on the ground in their thick cord breeches in this sweltering
         heat, a prey to flies and mosquitoes.</p>
      
      
      <p>Discussing the landing of the New Divisions in <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay and the
         diversion to be made by Legge on the right by storming Lone Pine,
         <span class="person">Birdwood</span> makes it clear in a letter just to hand, that he has told his
         two Divisional Generals everything. I had not yet gone into some of
         these details with <span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span>, <span class="person">Stopford</span> or Bailloud, all Corps
         Commanders, for I am afraid of the news filtering down to the juniors
         and from them, in the mysterious way news does pass, to the rank and
         file of both services. Thence to the Turks is but a step. Were the Turks
         to get wind of our plan, there would be nothing for it but to change the
         whole thing, even now, at the eleventh hour.</p>
      
      
      <p>Lieutenant-Colonel F. G. Fuller, my late G.S.O. (1) in the Central
         Force, came over to lunch. He is now G.S.O. (2) of the <span class="unit">9th Corps</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 5.30 p.m. rode over to "K" Beach for the second time and inspected
         the Indian Brigade under Brigadier-General <span class="person">Cox</span>. They had to be pulled
         out some time ago and given a rest. On parade were the 5th, 6th and 10th
         Gurkha Battalions with the 14th Sikhs. Walked down both lines and
         chatted with the British and Indian Officers. The men looked cheerful
         and much recovered. In the evening Charlie Burn, King's Messenger, and
         Captain Glyn came to dinner. Glyn has been sent out as a sort of
         emissary, but whether by <span class="person">K.</span> or by the Intelligence or by the Admiralty
         neither <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> nor I are quite able to understand.</p>
      
      
      <p>Cabled the War Office  insisting  that the lack of ammunition is
         "disturbing." Also, that "half my anxieties would vanish" if only the
         Master-General of Ordnance would see to it himself that the fortnightly
         allowance could be despatched regularly. I could hardly put it stronger.</p>
      
      
      <p> Midnight. --Just back from G.S. tent with the latest. So far, so good.
         Bailloud and <span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span> have carried two lines of Turkish trenches,
         an advance of two to four hundred yards. But the ammunition question has
         reached a crisis, and has become dangerous--very dangerous. On the whole
         Southern theatre of operations, counting shell in limbers and shell
         loaded in guns, we have 5,000 rounds of shrapnel. No high explosive--and
         fighting is still going on!</p>
      
      
      <p>   Hi jaculis illi certant defendere saxis. </p>
      
      
      <p>To whomsoever of my ancestors bequeathed me my power of detachment deep
         salaams! How many much better men than myself would not close their eyes
         to-night with a battle on the balance and 5,000 rounds wherewith to
         fight it? But I shall sleep--D.V.; I can't create shell by taking
         thought any more than Gouraud could retake the  Haricot  by not drinking
         his coffee.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 16th July, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Forcing myself to work though I feel
         unspeakably slack; wrangling with the War Office about doctors, nurses,
         orderlies and ships for our August battles. A few days ago I sent the
         following cable and they want to cut us down:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"It seems likely that during the first week of August we may have 80,000
         rifles in the firing line striving for a decisive result, and therefore
         certain that we shall then need more medical assistance. Quite
         impossible to foresee casualties, but suppose, for example, we suffered
         a loss of 20,000 men; though the figure seems alarming when put down in
         cold blood, it is not an extravagant proportion when calculated on basis
         of <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> fighting up to date. If this figure is translated into
         terms of requirements such a battle would involve conversion of, say, 30
         transports into temporary hospital ships, and necessitate something like
         200 extra medical officers, with Royal Army Medical Corps rank and file
         and nurses in proportion. If my prognosis is concurred in, these should
         reach <span class="location">Mudros</span> on or about 1st August. Some would D.V., prove superfluous,
         and could be sent back at once, and in any case they could return as
         soon as possible after operations, say, 1st September. Medical and
         surgical equipment, drugs, mattresses in due proportion. In a separate
         message I will deal with the deficiencies in ordinary establishment, but
         I think it best to keep this cable as to specified and exceptional
         demands distinct."</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 17th July, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> After lunch felt so sick of scribble,
         scribble, scribble whilst adventure sat seductive upon my doorstep that
         I fluttered forth. At 2 o'clock boarded <span class="location">H.M.S.  Savage </span>
         (Lieutenant-Commander Homer) and, with <span class="person">Aspinall</span> and Freddie, steered for
         Gully Beach. We didn't cast anchor but got into a cockleshell of a small
         dinghy and rowed ashore under the cliffs, where we were met by <span class="person">de Lisle</span>.
         Along the beach men were either bathing or basking mother-naked on the
         hot sand--enjoying themselves thoroughly. I walked on the edge of the
         sea, as far as the point which hides the gully's mouth from the Turkish
         gunners, and was specially struck by the physique and class of the 6th
         East Lancashires under Colonel Cole Hamilton. Then mounted and rode to
         the Headquarters of General Shaw, commanding the 13th (new) Division.
         Shaw was feeling his wounds; he had already been once round his lines;
         so I would not let him come again. But Colonel Gillivan, G.S.O.1, Major
         Hillyard, G.S.O.2, Captain Jackson, G.S.O.3, Colonel Burton, A.A. and
         Q.M.G., joined us. First we went to the Headquarters of the 39th Brigade
         commanded by Brigadier-General Cayley (the Brigade Major is Captain
         Simpson). Then I went and looked at the trenches J.11-12-13, where I met
         Colonel Palmer of the 9th Warwicks, Colonel Jordan, D.S.O., of the 7th
         Gloucesters, Colonel Nunn of the 9th Worcesters, Colonel Andrews of the
         7th North Staffordshires. We tramped through miles of trenches. The men
         were very fit and cheery. It was the day when they were relieving one
         another by companies from the reserve and there was a big crowd in the
         Ravine. <span class="person">De Lisle</span> told me that one week had made the most astonishing
         difference to the savvy of these first arrivals of the New Army. At
         first there was confusion, loss of energy and time; by the end of the
         week they had picked up the wrinkles of the veterans. There was a good
         lot of shelling from the Turks but, humanly speaking, we were all quite
         snug and safe in the big gully or moving down the deep communication
         trenches. No one, not even the new <span class="unit">13th Division</span>, paid the smallest
         deference to the projectiles.</p>
      
      
      <p>Now began one of these semi-comic, semi-serious adventures which seem to
         dog my footsteps. Just as I got into the little dinghy, two bluejackets
         pulling and a Petty Officer steering, the Turks began to shell <span class="location">H.M.S.
            Savage </span> as she lay about a hundred yards out. She did not like it, and,
         instead of waiting to let us get aboard, Commander Homer thought it
         wiser to sheer off about half a mile. When she quitted the Turks turned
         their guns on to our cockleshell, and although none of the shot came
         near us they still came quite near enough to interest the whole gallery
         of some thousands of bathing Tommies who, themselves safe in the dead
         ground under the cliff, were hugely amused to see their C.-in-C. having
         a hot time of it. After ten minutes hard rowing we got close to the
         destroyer and she, making a big circle at fairly high speed, came along
         fast as if she was going to run us down, with the idea of baffling the
         aim of the enemy. Not a bad notion as far as the destroyer was concerned
         but one demanding acrobatic qualities of a very high order on the part
         of the Commander-in-Chief. Anyway just as she was drawing abreast and I
         was standing up to make my spring a shell hit her plump and burst in one
         of her coal bunkers, sending up a big cloud of mixed smoke and black
         coal dust. The Commander was beside himself. He waved us off furiously;
         cracked on full steam and again left us in the lurch. We laughed till
         the tears ran down our cheeks. Soon, we had reason to be more serious,
         not to say pensive. The <span class="location"> Savage </span> showed a pair of clean heels this time
         and ran right away to <span class="location">Helles</span>. So there we were, marooned, half a mile
         out to sea, in a tiny dinghy on which the Turks again switched their
         blarsted guns. The two bluejackets pulled themselves purple. They were
         both of them fat reservists and the mingling of anxiety and exertion,
         emotion and motion, made the sweat pour in torrents down their cheeks.
         Each time a shell plunked into the water we brightened up; then,
         gradually, until the next one splashed, our faces grew longer and
         longer. At last we got so far away that the Turks gave us up in disgust.
         How much I should like to see that battery commander's diary.
         Altogether, by the time we had boarded the <span class="location"> Savage </span>, we had been in that
         cursed little dinghy for just exactly one hour, of which I should think
         we were being gently shelled for three quarters of an hour. On board the
         destroyer no harm to speak of: only one man wounded.</p>
      
      
      <p>Cast anchor at <span class="location">Imbros</span> at 9 p.m. General Legge and Captain H. Lloyd came
         over to stay the night. Mail from England.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have cabled again to stir them up about the hospital ships.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 18th July, 1915.  Church Parade. Inspected troops. Wrote in camp all
         the afternoon. Walked out to the lighthouse in the evening and watched
         the shells bursting over Gully Beach where we were yesterday. How often
         have I felt anxious seeing these shrapnel through the telescope. On the
         spot, as I know from yesterday's experience, their bark is worse than
         their bite. Colonel Ward of the Intelligence came to dinner and Captain
         Doughtie, commanding <span class="location">H.M.S.  Abercrombie </span>, paid me a visit.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 19th July, 1915.  Too much office work. Mr. Schuler, an Australian
         journalist and war correspondent, turned up. Seems a highly intelligent
         young fellow. He had met me on tour in Australia. Gave him leave to go
         anywhere and see everything. The Staff shake their heads, but the future
         is locked away in our heads, and the more the past is known the better
         for us.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Braithwaite</span> has heard from the War Office that the Brigade of Russians
         which had started from Vladivostock to join us here has been
         counter-ordered. The War Office seem rather pleased than otherwise that
         this reinforcement has fallen through. Why, I can't imagine. As they are
         sending us a big fresh force of Britishers, they probably persuade
         themselves that 5,000 Russians would be more trouble than they are
         worth, but they forget the many thousands of shortage in my present
         formations. Since they fixed up to send me the new Divisions I must have
         lost ten thousand rifles, but as all my old Divisions remain at the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>  in name , they are being regarded at home, we strongly
         suspect, as a sort of widow's cruse, kept full by miracles instead of
         men and still, therefore,--Divisions!</p>
      
      
      <p>In the evening the Vice-Admiral came over and we rode together down to
         the Naval Seaplane Camp. The King's Messenger left at 5 p.m.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 20th July, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Wrote double quick, then galloped over to
         Kephalos to see the New Army,  sub rosa . The men we struck were A.1.
         They belong to the <span class="unit">32nd</span> and <span class="unit">34th</span> Brigades of the <span class="unit">11th Division</span>. The <span class="unit">33rd</span>
         has gone to <span class="location">Helles</span> to get salted.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span> is still staying with the Admiral. He has had a hard time
         and a heavy responsibility and is quite worn out. I devoutly trust he
         may be on his legs again ere long. Have put in <span class="person">Stopford</span> to act for him
         at <span class="location">Helles</span>. This should teach the young idea how to shoot. With every
         aspect of the command and administration of the Southern theatre of
         operations thus under his immediate orders he has a rare chance of
         learning how to do it and how not to do it.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 21st July, 1915. --Just signed a letter to the Chief of the Imperial
         General Staff and as it gives the run of my thoughts at the moment I
         spatchcock the opening and final paras:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"My dear Wolfe <span class="person">Murray</span>,</p>
      
      
      <p>"How do you manage to find time to write these charming letters of yours
         with your own hand? They come like a gift from some oriental potentate
         and carry with them the same moral obligations; i.e., that they ought to
         be returned in kind. But to-day the time limit interposes, and I know
         you will pardon me for once if I dictate.</p>
      
      
      <p>"I am immensely interested in what you say with reference to the <span class="unit">29th</span>
         Division being below strength, namely, that we are getting short of men.
         Well,--though one of the keenest voluntary service people existing, I
         have always envisaged the fact that during a war we might be driven
         to compulsion. Also in writing out fully my views on this subject (views
         which I was not permitted by late Chiefs of the General Staff to
         publish) I have always, for that reason, pressed for National
         Registration. It does no one any harm, and rubs into the mind of the
         young man that, under certain conditions, the State has first pull on
         his pocket, labour, life and everything else. But, of course, if your
         own wish that the <span class="unit">29th</span> Division should take out 10 per cent. extra for
         drafts (like the regiments do in France), had been carried into effect,
         they would never have fallen as low as they actually did.</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"<span class="person">Freddy Stopford</span> and Reed have been staying with me for 24 hours, and
         the former is now in command of the <span class="unit">8th Corps</span> on the Peninsula,
         <span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span> having gone sick. He asked to stay with the Admiral for a
         couple of days' rest, and the very moment he got safe on board ship the
         overstrain of the past month told on him and he went down with a sharp
         go of fever. I earnestly pray he will get right again quickly for there
         are not many Commanders of his calibre. <span class="person">Freddy Stopford</span> will now have a
         good chance of getting the hang of this sort of fighting generally,
         surrounded as he will be by <span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span>'s experienced Staff. After
         sending my last letter I rather repented of one or two harsh things I
         said about Reed. There is some truth in them, but I need not have said
         them. I hope he will do very well out here."</p>
      
      
      <p>Now since that letter was written (yesterday) in comes a cable from <span class="person">K.</span>
         saying Winston can't leave England but that Hankey starts in his place.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">K.</span> says he is sure I will give him every facility.</p>
      
      
      <p>A pretty stuffy cable in from the War Office on the Hospital ships and
         medical personnel and material wrangle which is still going on. I,
         personally, have checked every item of my estimate with closest personal
         attention, although it took me hours in the midst of other very pressing
         duties. This is not <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>'s pidgin but Woodward's and there was no
         help for it. Our first landing found out a number of chinks in our
         arrangements, and now, my Director of Medical Services is (quite
         naturally) inclined to open his mouth as wide as if ships were drugs in
         the market. So I have tried very hard, without too much help, to hit the
         mean between extravagance and sufficiency. Now the War Office, who would
         be the first to round on me if anything went wrong with my wounded,
         query my demands as if we had just splashed off a cable asking for the
         first things that came into our heads!</p>
      
      
      <p>I am all for thrift in ships, but thrift in the lives of my wounded
         comes first; my conscience is clear and I have answered sticking to my
         point,--firmly! They say the thing is impossible; I have retaliated by
         saying it is imperative.</p>

      <p>CHAPTER XIV THE FORCE--REAL AND IMAGINARY</p>
      
      
      <p> 22nd July, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Had a jolly outing to-day. Left for Cape
         <span class="location">Helles</span> by trawler just before 10 o'clock. <span class="person">Aspinall</span>, Bertier and young
         Brodrick came with me. Lunched at 8th Army Corps Headquarters with
         <span class="person">Stopford</span> and handed him a first outline scheme of the impending
         operations. We read it through together and he seems to take all the
         points and to be in general agreement. Left <span class="person">Aspinall</span> behind to explain
         any questions of detail which might not seem clear, whilst I went a tour
         of inspection through the Eski Lines of trenches held by the 6th and 7th
         Manchesters of the 42nd Division. These Eski Lines were first held about
         the 7th or 8th May and have since been worked up, mainly by the energy
         of <span class="person">de Lisle</span>, into fortifications, humanly speaking, impregnable. General
         Douglas, Commander of the Division, came round with me. He reminds me
         greatly of his brother, the late Chief of the Imperial General Staff;
         excellent at detail; a conscientious, very hard worker. When I had seen
         my Manchester friends I passed on into the <span class="unit">Royal Naval Division</span> Lines.
         There General <span class="person">Paris</span> convoyed me through his section as far as
         Zimmerman's Farm, where I was joined by Bailloud with his Chief of Staff
         and Chief of Operations. Together we made our way round the whole of
         the French trenches winding up at de Tott's Battery.</p>
      
      
      <p>After this whopping walk, we left by pinnace from below de Tott's
         wondering whether the Asiatic Batteries would think us game worth their
         powder and shot. They did not and so we safely boarded our trawler at
         Cape <span class="location">Helles</span>. Didn't get back to <span class="location">Imbros</span> Harbour till 9 p.m. Being so
         late, boarded the ever hospitable  Triad  on chance and struck, as
         usual--hospitality. <span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span> is really quite ill with fever. He did
         not want to see anyone. As we were sitting at dinner I saw him through
         the half open door staggering along on his way to get into a launch to
         go aboard a Hospital ship. He is suffering very much from his head. The
         doctors prophesy that he will pull round in about a week. I hope so
         indeed, but I have my doubts. <span class="person">Aspinall</span> reports that <span class="person">Stopford</span> is entirely
         in accord with our project and keen.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 23rd July, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Spent day in camp trying to straighten things
         out: (1) the personal, (2) the strategical and (3) the administrative
         arrangements.</p>
      
      
      <p>(1) <span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span> has to go home and I have begged for Bruce Hamilton in
         his place, and have told them I would have a great champion in him. He
         and Smith-Dorrien were my best Brigadiers in South Africa. They stood on
         my right hand and on my left all the way between Bloemfontein and
         Pretoria, and I never quite made up my mind as to which was the better.
         Bruce is a fighting man with an iron frame, and, in <span class="location">Gallipoli</span>, his
         chief crab, his deafness, will be rather a gain to him.</p>
      
      
      <p>(2) Bailloud, with his own War Minister in the background, is doing all
         he knows to get 20,000 of my new troops allotted to a side show, not for
         strategy's sake, but for the tactical relief of his troops from the
         shelling. I quite sympathize with his reason as, after all, he is
         responsible for his own troops and not for the larger issue. But, to
         take one objection only, the Navy could not land a force at Besika Bay
         and at the same time carry out landings at <span class="location">Suvla</span> and Anzac. Again, since
         Bailloud urged these views, the guns fixed up at de Tott's Battery have
         already begun to gain mastery over the fire from the site of Troy. When
         we have one of the new 14-inch gunned monitors moored off Rabbit Island
         we shall get cross fire observations and give the Turkish Asiatic guns
         the clean knock out. Amphibious operations are ticklish things: allied
         operations are ticklish things: but the two together are like skating on
         thin ice arm in arm with two friends who each want to cut a figure of
         his own.</p>
      
      
      <p>(3) Slovenly bills of lading. Bertie Lawrence, who was sent to <span class="location">Mudros</span> in
         June when things were growing desperate, was here yesterday and has made
         a report on the present business situation which, though less chaotic,
         is still serious. There are not launches enough to enable people to get
         about. There are not lighters enough to work the daily transhipment of
         300 tons. But the worst trouble lies in the bills of lading. Sometimes
         they arrive a week after their ships. Usually cargo shipped at Malta or
         Alexandria is omitted. Half the time we can't lay hands on vital plant,
         tackle, supplies, munitions, because we have no means of knowing what
         is, or is not, on board some ship in the harbour. The trouble is of old
         date but has reached its climax owing to our shortage of rounds for our
         18-pounders.</p>
      
      
      <p>We were notified a new fuse key would be required for the new shells on
         the 12th June. The shells arrived but the keys were not despatched till
         the 15th July! The vouchers are all wrong, and there, in idleness, lies
         the stuff that spells success. A soldier is not a conjurer that he
         should be handed over a fully laden ship and told to ferret out a fuse
         key.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 24th July, 1915.  Last night the Turkish Commander drove his troops
         into their tenth attack upon our extreme left where they were beaten off
         as usual with a loss of several hundreds--this time we only suffered
         about a dozen casualties. Together with <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>, I rode over to "K"
         Beach at 11 a.m. to inspect part of the <span class="unit">11th Division</span> there encamped.
         General Hammersley, Divisional Commander, met me. Also Colonel Malcolm,
         his General Staff Officer and Major Duncan. The first Brigade I looked
         at was Sitwell's--the <span class="unit">34th</span>. A fine looking lot of men:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  8th Northumberland Fusiliers,
         5th Dorsets,
         9th <span class="unit">Lancashire Fusiliers</span>,
         1 Coy. 11th Manchester Fusilers.</p>
      
      
      <p>Next I passed on to Haggard's Brigade--the <span class="unit">32nd</span>. On parade were--</p>
      
      
      <p>  9th West Yorkshires,
         6th Yorkshires,
         8th West Riding Regiment,
         6th York and Lancashires.</p>
      
      
      <p>Lastly I inspected the 67th and 68th Companies R.E. of the 1<span class="unit">34th</span>
         Fortress Company, as well as the Field Ambulance. Officers and men
         looked splendid. I was glad indeed to be able to congratulate Hammersley
         on his command. The doctors tell me, that, short as has been their stay,
         a large number of the men are already infected by the prevalent disease.
         Well, they don't look like that,--and it won't kill them that's certain,
         for I have had it on me strong for the best part of two months. But it
         knocks out the starch from its victims, and if fair play existed in
         moonlit lands, every white man here should be credited with 25 per cent.
         extra kudos for everything that he does with his brains or his body
         under the shadow of this pestilence.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have got a reply from the War Office (Q.M.G.2) making light of my
         shipping troubles and saying the War Office has always cabled full
         advices. What can I say to that? As the lamb thought to himself when the
         wolf began to growl.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 25th July, 1915.  Spent most of the day in camp. Church Parade at 9
         a.m. Charles Lister came over from "K" Beach to lunch. He is a
         fascinating creature and has made a name for himself with the Naval
         Division, where standards are high, as being the keenest of the keen
         and the bravest of the brave. Hammersley, Malcolm and Aitkin called in
         the evening, but I had gone for a stroll and missed them.</p>
      
      
      <p>The great Turkish attack timed by all our spies for the 23rd has never
         come off but, as showing the fine spirit which animates the Anzacs, it
         is worth noting that on that day not one soul reported sick. They would
         not go near the doctors for fear they might be made to miss a battle.</p>
      
      
      <p>Last night the French took a small trench, and though the Turks had a
         dash at it in the morning, they were easily beaten off. Twice out of
         three times we gain something when we fight and the third time we lose
         no ground.</p>
      
      
      <p>Given, therefore, the factors of the problem, men, munitions and the
         distance to be covered (two to three miles), the result pans out like a
         proposition by Euclid. No question of breaking through is involved as in
         any other theatre, but merely a question of pushing back a very clearly
         limited number of yards. The men have in their hearts a reservoir of
         patience which will never run dry so long as they are sure of the Will
         to Win at their backs. They need have no qualms about G.H.Q. here, but
         politicians are more--shall we say, mercurial? And the experts from
         France are throwing cold water on our cause by day and night. Therefore,
         as the Fleet is not going to have a dash, it is just as well we are
         about to try the one great effort and get it done quickly. We will gain
         a lot of ground; so much is certain, and it's as sure as anything can
         be in war that somewhere we shall make good a key to the position.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 26th July, 1915.  Stifling. Am sticking out about the lack of proper
         advices of shipments. Ammunition  makes  itself scarce enough without
         being  made  scarce. Rare and curious articles are worth careful
         booking; that's the text of my cable.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 27th July, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Hard at it. <span class="person">Altham</span> came in to see me and
         spent an hour and a half. A man of business! Mahon arrived at mid-day.
         Very cheery but he feels that he is the only Lieutenant-General
         executively employed with troops who has so small a command as a
         Division. He says that either he should be given a Corps, or that
         his Lieutenant-General's rank should be reverted to that of
         Major-General. I quite agreed. I feel as strongly as he does that, as a
         Lieutenant-General, he is clean out of his setting in a Major-General's
         appointment and has blocked the way to a go-ahead young Corps Commander,
         because that Corps Commander must, by <span class="person">K.</span>'s decision, be his senior.
         Still, there didn't seem to be anything to be done, so after my telling
         him how things stood here, and hearing with great pleasure the fine
         account he gave me of his Irish Division, we adjourned to lunch. Colonel
         King, his G.S.O. (1), also lunched and seemed to be a very nice fellow.
         After lunch they both went off to the G.S. to be posted.</p>
      
      
      <p>Admiral Wemyss came over from <span class="location">Mudros</span> and saw me. He is senior to de
         Robeck but has waived that accident of rank seeing we are at war. An
         interesting man and a <span class="person">Keyes</span>ite; i.e., he'd go right through the Straits
         to-morrow,--or go under. He is one of those men, none too common in the
         Services, whose mind has gained breadth in the great world without
         losing its keenness. These rival tenets are straining the fabric of the
         Fleet, but, as I constantly tell our General Staff, my course is as
         clear to me as a pikestaff. I back the policy of the  de facto  Naval
         Commander-in-Chief--my own coadjutor. There is a temptation to do wrong,
         but I resist it. What would it not be to me were the whole Fleet to
         attack as we land at <span class="location">Suvla</span>! But obviously I cannot go out of my own
         element to urge the Fleet to actions, the perils of which I am
         professionally incompetent to gauge.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 5.30 p.m. I went off riding with <span class="person">de Robeck</span>, Ormsby Johnson and
         Freddie <span class="person">Maitland</span>. We cantered over to Seaplane Camp; passed the time of
         day to the men there and over-hauled some of the machines. Coming back,
         we passed through part of the <span class="unit">11th Division</span> Camp; all very ship-shape
         and clean. Freddie <span class="person">Maitland</span> and I dined on board the  Beryl  with Sir
         Douglas Gamble. He seems highly pleased with everyone and everything; I
         wouldn't go quite so far! There we met <span class="person">de Robeck</span>, <span class="person">Keyes</span>, <span class="person">Altham</span>, <span class="person">Ellison</span>
         and Captain Stephens. Got back at 11.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 28th July, 1915.  A cable from <span class="person">K.</span> about <span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span>'s breakdown,
         telling me the Prime Minister thinks that Bruce Hamilton is too old for
         active work and heavy strain. Instead I am to have <span class="person">Davies</span>. I know Joey
         <span class="person">Davies</span>--everyone does. But I also know Bruce Hamilton. There is no
         tougher man or more resolute fighter in the Army. In my letter to <span class="person">K.</span> I
         said, "The only man I can think of who would really inspire me with full
         confidence in these emergencies, excursions and alarms, would be Bruce
         Hamilton. Bruce Hamilton is a real fighting man, and his deafness here
         would be a great asset as he would be able to sleep through the shell
         and rifle fire at night."</p>
      
      
      <p>The older Officers will be sorry indeed to hear Bruce Hamilton is
         barred. Shaw, the new Commander of the <span class="unit">13th Division</span>, will be especially
         disappointed.</p>
      
      
      <p>Admiral Gamble came off to see me and afterwards dined. I was very
         careful as I don't want to be quoted about the Sister Service. Gamble
         sings praise of our outfit, but I can't help wondering how, when and
         where he has got it into his head that we have small craft in abundance!</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 29th July, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Stuck to camp, and lucky I did so, for the
         cipher of a queer cable from S. of S. for War came in and called for as
         much thought as is compatible with prompt handling. The message begins
         with a ripe sugar plum:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"At this stage of the operations which you have conducted with so much
         ability and in which your troops have so greatly distinguished
         themselves, we" (this "we" is a new expression; the S. of S. always says
         "I") "consider it advisable to summarize what we are placing at your
         disposal for the effort which we hope will bring your operations to a
         successful termination.</p>
      
      
      <p>"We have sent you out" and then the cable launches out into an inventory
         of the forces entrusted to me which, though very detailed, is yet
         largely based on what we call the widow's cruse principle. As to the
         demnition total, "we" tells "me," categorically, (as the Lawyers say
         when they describe the whiteness of soot) that I have "a total of about
         205,000 men for the forthcoming operations." The A.G. who brought me the
         cable could make nothing of it. <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> then came over and he could
         make nothing of it. We can none of us see the point of pretending to
         us  that my force has been kept up to the strength all the time, or of
         adding bayonets to the French or of assuming to  us  that  we  possess
         troops which Maxwell has told me time and again he requires for Egyptian
         defence. Were these figures going to the enemy Chief they might
         intimidate him--coming here they alarm me. There is a "We" at the other
         end of the cable which knows so little that it tells me, who know every
         gun, rifle and round of ammunition I have at my disposal, that I have
         double that number to handle. We won't defeat the enemy by paper
         strengths. As far as sentiments go, the cable is by chalks the heartiest
         handshake we poor relations to the West have had since we started. From
         the outset we've been kicked by phrases such as, if you don't hurry up
         we will have to "reconsider the position," etc., etc. Now, the "Wees"
         wind up with a really wonderful paragraph:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"We should like to hear from you after considering your plans whether
         there is anything further in the way of personnel, guns or ammunition we
         can send you, as we are most anxious to give you everything you can
         possibly require and use. You will realize that as regards ammunition we
         have had to stop supplying France to give you the full output, which
         will be continued as long as possible; in the short time available
         before the bad weather intervenes the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> operations are now of
         the highest importance."</p>
      
      
      <p>The position seems now, to me, extraordinarily delicate. Are we to let
         the mistakes in this flattering cable slide, and build upon its
         promises, or, are we to pull whoever believes these figures out of their
         fool's paradise? Well, I feel we must have it out and although deeply
         grateful for the nice words and for the splendid effort actually being
         made, we  cannot  let it be assumed by  anyone  that our vanishing Naval
         and Territorial Divisions are complete and up to strength. As to
         ammunition, I asked plainly over a fortnight ago, for what I thought was
         necessary to rapid success. I was told in so many words that France
         would not spare it; though it would have been a small affair to them.
         Now; as if these cables had no existence, they ask if there is "anything
         in the way of  personnel, guns or ammunition you can possibly require
         and use ." The truth is, I don't like this cable; in spite of its
         flowery opening I don't like it at all. As to personnel, I ask for young
         and energetic commanders, <span class="person">Byng</span> and Rawlinson, and am turned down. Next I
         ask for an old and experienced Commander, Bruce Hamilton, and am turned
         down. Next I say that Reed, who would be a good staff officer to some
         Generals, is not well suited to <span class="person">Stopford</span>; I am turned down. I try to get
         a business man to run <span class="location">Mudros</span> and have been turned down till just the
         other day. In all these points the War Office are supreme and are acting
         well within their rights. But they show some want of consistency in
         talking to me all of a sudden, as if it was a matter of course I should
         be met half way in my wishes.</p>
      
      
      <p>So there and then we roughed out this reply:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"Your Nos. 6583 and 6588. Your appreciation of our efforts will afford
         intense gratification and encouragement to everyone.</p>
      
      
      <p>"In regard to what we should like if it is available in the shape of
         guns and ammunition, please see my No. M.F. 444, of 13th July, which
         still holds good. As to the final paragraph of your No. 6583, I did not
         realize that you were stopping supplies to France in order to give us
         full output, since a fortnight ago your No. 6234 stated that it was then
         impossible for you to send the ammunition I asked for, and that it would
         be impossible to continue supplies even on a much lower scale, since it
         would involve the reduction of supplies to France. Naturally, I have
         always realized that you, and not I, must judge of the comparative
         importance of the demands from the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> and from France.</p>
      
      
      <p>"With regard to numbers, the grand total you mention does not take into
         account non-effectives or casualties; it includes reinforcements such as
         <span class="unit">LIVth</span> and part of the <span class="unit">LIIIth</span> Divisions, etc., which cannot be here in
         time for my operation, and it also includes Yeomanry and Indian troops
         which, until this morning, I was unaware were at my unreserved disposal.
         For the coming operation, the number of rifles available is about half
         the figure you quote, viz., 120,000. I am only anxious, in emphasizing
         this point, to place the statement regarding my strength on the correct
         basis, and one which gives a true view of the position.</p>
      
      
      <p>"What I want in a hurry is as much additional high explosive shell as
         you can send me up to amounts asked for in my No. M.F. 444, and as many
         of the 4.5-inch and 6-inch howitzers asked for in that telegram as there
         is ammunition for. I am despatching a ship immediately, and its time of
         arrival at Marseilles will be telegraphed later.</p>
      
      
      <p>"With regard to sending the IInd Mounted Division unmounted, I am at
         once telegraphing Maxwell to obtain his views."</p>
      
      
      <p>The Mail bag went out this morning.</p>
      
      
      <p>Hankey is now busy going over the Peninsula. I have not seen much of
         him. A G.S. Officer has been told off to help him along and to see that
         he does not get into trouble. I am not going to dry nurse him. He showed
         me of his own free will a copy of a personal cable he had sent to Lord
         Kitchener in which he says, speaking of his first visit to Anzac,
         "Australians are superbly confident and spoiling for a fight." This is
         exactly true and I feel it is good that one who has the ear of the
         insiders should say it. I wrote Wolfe <span class="person">Murray</span> a week ago that he was a
         successor to those Commissioners who were sent out by the French
         Republic in its early days. Actually, I am very glad to have him. Lies
         are on the wing, and he, armed with the truth, will be able to knock
         some of them out hereafter when he meets them in high places.</p>
      
      
      <p>I have been bothered as to how to answer a letter from a statesman for
         whom I cherish great respect, who has always been very kind to me and
         whom I like very much. He writes:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"It may interest you to know the Cabinet has entrusted the
         superintendence of the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> business to a comparatively small and
         really strong committee drawn equally from the two parties. We most
         thoroughly understand the extreme difficulty of your task and the
         special conditions of the problem in front of you and the Admiral. All
         we ask from you is complete confidence and the exact truth. We are not
         babes and we can digest strong meat. Do not think that we ever want
         anything unpleasant concealed from us, nor do we want you ever to swerve
         one hair's breadth from your own exact judgment in putting the case
         before us, certainly never on the pleasant side; if you ever swerve pray
         do so on the unpleasant side.... If you want more ammunition say so...."</p>
      
      
      <p>"Could you eat a bun, my boy?" said the old gentleman to the little boy
         looking in at the shop window. "Could I eat ten thousand b ... buns and
         the baker who baked them?" So the dear little fellow answered. If I want
         more ammunition indeed? If ...? I fear the "comparatively small and
         really strong committee." They fairly frighten me. There they sit, all
         wishing us well, all evidently completely bamboozled. "If you want more
         ammunition, say so!" Anyway, my friend means me well but my path is
         perfectly clear; I have only one Chief--<span class="person">K.</span>--and I correspond with no one
         but him, or his Staff, whether on the subject of ammunition or anything
         else....</p>
      
      
      <p>As to the letter, I know it is entirely kind, genuine and inspired by
         the one idea of helping me. But I've got to say no thank you in some
         unmistakable manner. So I have replied:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"I am grateful for your reassuring remarks about your Committee having
         confidence in my humble self. For my part I have confidence in the
         moral  of my troops and in the devotion of the Navy which are the two
         great and splendid assets amidst this shifting kaleidoscope of the
         factors and possibilities of war.</p>
      
      
      <p>"I am not quite sure that I clearly understand your meaning about
         cabling home the exact truth. Is there any occasion on which I have
         failed to do so? I should be very sorry indeed to think I had
         consciously or unconsciously misled anyone by my cables. There is
         always, of course, the broad spirit of a cable which depends on the
         temperament of the sender. It is either tinged with hope or it has been
         dictated by one who fears the worst. If you mean that you would prefer a
         pessimistic tone given to my appreciations, then I am afraid you will
         have to get another General."</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 30th July, 1915.  Gascoigne of "Q" branch lunched. On getting news of
         the decisive victory on the Euphrates I caused a  feu de joie  to be
         fired precisely at 5 p.m. by all the troops on the Peninsula. At the
         appointed hour I walked up the cliff's edge whence I clearly heard the
         roll of fire. The question of whether musketry sounds will carry so far
         is settled. Evidently the Turks have taken up the challenge for it was
         quite a long time before the distant rumbling died away. In the cool of
         the evening took a walk. Commandant Bertier and la Borde dined.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Stopford</span>, now commanding at <span class="location">Helles</span>, has endorsed a report from the
         Commander of the 42nd <span class="unit">East Lancs</span> Division saying that out of a draft of
         45 recruits just come from home three have been cast as totally unfit
         and nine as permanently unfit through blindness. <span class="person">Stopford</span> says that he
         can't understand this, as the second line Battalion, from which these
         poor fellows were selected, contained good soldiers and tall fellows
         quite lately when they were under his command in England. Have cabled
         the facts home; also the following, showing the result of the
         Admiralty's attitude towards their own Naval Division now Winston has
         departed:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F. 505). From General <span class="person">Sir Ian Hamilton</span> to War Office. The
         effective strength of the Marine Brigade is now reduced to 50 officers
         and 1,890 rank and file. In addition, only five battalions, Royal Naval
         Volunteer Reserve Battalions, are now remaining in the Division, as the
         Anson Battalion has been withdrawn for special work in connection with
         the forthcoming operations. Moreover, 300 men, stokers, from this
         division have been handed over to the Navy for work in auxiliary
         vessels, see my telegram No. M.F.A. 1377, of 11th July. I have
         consequently decided to reduce the division to eight battalions and to
         reorganize it into two brigades as a temporary measure. Can you give me
         any idea when the reinforcements for this division are likely to be
         despatched and when they may be expected here? I should like to see the
         division again at its strength of 12 battalions, and do not want to lose
         it, as it contains a very valuable war-trained nucleus, but unless it is
         brought under army administration, it does not appear likely that it can
         be maintained."</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 31st July, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Quiet day spent in trying to clear my table
         before sailing for Mitylene to see the new Irish Division. The grand
         army with which some War Office genius credited us appear to have served
         their purpose. At our challenge they have now taken to their heels like
         Falstaff's eleven rogues in buckram suits. The S. of S. (cabling this
         time as "I" and not as "We,") says, "it is not worth while trying to
         reconcile numbers by cable and it is difficult to make up accurate
         states."</p>
      
      
      <p>Do not let me forget, though, that a slice of solid stuff is sandwiched
         into this cable--we are to get some 4.5 shell  via  Marseilles; H.E. we
         hope: also, two batteries of 4.5 howitzers: also that the A.G. has been
         trying hard to feed the <span class="unit">29th</span> Division. The Territorials are the people
         who are being allowed to go to pot--not a word of hope even, and before
         the eyes of everyone.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 1st August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> The usual rush before leaving. No time to
         write. Sent two cables, copies attached. The first to the War Office, in
         answer to one from the A.G. wherein he plumes himself upon the
         completeness of the <span class="unit">29th</span> Division. That completeness, alas, is only so
         relatively; i.e., in comparison with the sinking condition of the
         Territorial Divisions:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"We are deeply grateful to you for the drafts you have despatched for
         the XXIXth Division as the fighting existence of that fine formation has
         been prolonged by their timely arrival, but I fear that you are very
         wide of the mark in your assumption that these drafts have completed the
         Division.</p>
      
      
      <p>"As I have ventured to point out incessantly since my arrival here,
         constant large numbers of casualties must occur between the demands for
         and the arrival of drafts owing to the length of the sea voyage. It was
         for this very plain reason that it was doubly necessary to have here the
         10 per cent. margin granted in the case of battalions going to France.
         We must always be considerably under establishment in the absence of
         some such margin.</p>
      
      
      <p>"I fully realize, in saying this, that it may be quite impossible to
         meet such demands as I suggest, but I feel bound to let you know the
         only possible terms on which any unit in this force can ever be up to
         establishment.</p>
      
      
      <p>"At the present moment, excluding 1,700 drafts coming on  Simla  and
         Themistocles , the actual infantry strength of the XXIXth Division is
         219 officers and 8,424 other ranks."</p>
      
      
      <p>The second cable is to <span class="person">K.</span> The War Office Army has melted into thin air
         and it only remains to express my heartfelt thanks for the real Army:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"With reference to your No. 6645. Very many thanks. You have done
         everything for us that man can do. The ship will probably not reach me
         in time but since I know that the ammunition is actually  en route  for
         me, and that it will (D.V.) arrive, I need not husband what we have, but
         can fire freely if I see great results thus obtainable. The Turk, at any
         rate, where he knows that he is fighting for Constantinople, is a
         stubborn fighter, and the difficulty is not so much in the taking of
         positions as in the maintaining of them.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Hence the extra ammunition you are sending me will come in the nick of
         time. The ship will arrive at Marseilles 7 p.m. 4th August, as I
         telegraphed to the Quartermaster-General yesterday. Many thanks for the
         two batteries of 4.5-inch howitzers, they are worth their weight in gold
         to us."</p>
      
      
      <p>At 5 p.m. embarked on H.M.S.  <span class="location">Chatham</span>  (Captain Drury Lowe) with George
         Lloyd of the General Staff and young Brodrick. At 6 p.m. sailed for
         Mitylene.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 2nd August, 1915. H.M.S. "<span class="location">Chatham</span>," Mitylene.  We opened Mitylene
         Harbour at 5.30 a.m. So narrow was the entrance, and so hidden, that at
         first it looked as if the  <span class="location">Chatham</span>  was charging the cliffs; next as if
         her long guns must entangle themselves in the flowering bushes on either
         side of the channel; then, as we sailed out over a bay like a big
         turquoise, I felt as though we were at peace with all men, making a
         pilgrimage to the home of Sappho, and that we had left far behind us
         these giant wars. But only for a moment!</p>
      
      
      <p>After early breakfast, where I met <span class="person">Captain Grant</span> of <span class="location">H.M.S. Canopus</span> ,
         left in a steam pinnace to inspect the <span class="unit">30th Brigade</span> under
         <span class="person">Brigadier-General Hill</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Inspected:--</p>

      <p>The Royal Irish Fusiliers and Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers had not got
         back on board ship by the time I was ready for them, so I hurried off
         by motor launch to a landing in another part of the Bay and, walking
         through a village, caught them resting by their piled arms after a route
         march. All of these men looked very well and cheery. The villagers were
         most friendly and had turned out in numbers, bringing presents of
         flowers and fruit. Not more than 60 per cent. of the men are Irish, the
         rest being either North of England miners or from Somerset.</p>
      
      
      <p>In the evening, crossed the glassy bay and motored to pay a
         double-barrelled visit to the Military and Civil Governors. Topping the
         watershed, yet another pleasure shock. Through the sea haze Mitylene
         shines out like an iridescent bubble of light. Never had I seen anything
         so vivid in its colour and setting as this very ancient, very small,
         very brilliant city of Mitylene. Rio de Janeiro, Sydney, the Golden Horn
         are sprawling daubs to flawless Mitylene.</p>
      
      
      <p>Hesketh Smith and Compton Mackenzie were with us. The Governors very
         polite. The soldier man is a Cretan and seemed a good sort. We took tea
         at the Hotel and then made our way back to the  <span class="location">Chatham</span> . Found messages
         from G.H.Q. to say all's well and stuff being smuggled in without hitch
         at Anzac. At 7 p.m. we sailed for <span class="location">Imbros</span>; a breeze from the West
         whipping up little waves into cover for enemy periscopes. So the moment
         we left the harbour we took on a corkscrew course, dodging and twisting
         like snipe in an Irish bog, to avoid winding up our trip in the dark
         belly of a German submarine. Soon emerged from the sea a huge piled up
         white cloud, white and clear cut at first as the breast of a swan upon
         a blue lake, slowly turning to deep rose colour flecked here and there
         with gold. As it swallowed up the last lingering colours of the sunset,
         the world grew grey, then black, and we were, humanly speaking, safe.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 3rd August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Anchored at <span class="location">Imbros</span> roadstead 5.30 a.m.
         <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> not up yet so <span class="person">Altham</span> got first innings about transport and
         supply.</p>
      
      
      <p>Next the G.S. All our preliminaries are working on quite smoothly
         towards the climax and, so far, it seems likely the Turks have no notion
         of the scheme.</p>
      
      
      <p>Girodon steamed over from <span class="location">Helles</span> to see me and went back again in the
         evening. He is the mirror of French chivalry, modesty and good form,
         besides being an extraordinary fine soldier.</p>
      
      
      <p>The <span class="unit">33rd</span> Brigade, sent by me to gain wisdom at <span class="location">Helles</span>, have now been
         brought here so that the whole <span class="unit">11th Division</span> can start off together.</p>
      
      
      <p>Just as the peculiar foggy air of Lancashire is essential to the weaving
         of the finer sorts of tissues, so an atmosphere of misunderstandings
         would really seem to suit the War Office.</p>
      
      
      <p>In the cable telling me I would have 205,000 troops for my push, the S.
         of S. had informed me categorically that the 8,500 Yeomanry and mounted
         troops in Egypt, as well as 11,500 Indian troops and the Artillery
         stationed there  were mine .</p>
      
      
      <p>As the present garrison of Egypt numbers over 70,000 and as the old
         peace garrison of Egypt was 5,000 and as, further, there is no question
         of serious attack on Egypt from outside, it seemed to us there might be
         men in this part of the message. Leaving the Indian troops out of the
         account, for the moment, I therefore wired to Maxwell and asked him if
         he thought he would be able to organize a  portion  of the 8,500 mounted
         men, in order that, at a pinch, they might be able to come and reinforce
         us here. So the matter stood when I got another cable from the S. of S.
         telling me 5,000 drafts are " en route  or under orders" to join the
         <span class="unit">29th</span> Division and that the War Office are "unable to carry out your
         views about additional marginal drafts." S. of S. then goes on:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"Maxwell wires that you are taking 300 officers and 5,000 men of his
         mounted troops. I do not quite understand why you require Egyptian
         Garrison troops while you have the <span class="unit">LIIIth</span> Division at Alexandria, and
         the <span class="unit">LIVth</span>, the last six battalions of which are arriving in five or six
         days, on the  Aquitania .</p>
      
      
      <p>"When I placed the Egyptian Garrison at your disposal to reinforce at
         the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> in case of necessity, Maxwell pointed out that Egypt
         would be left very short, and I replied that you would only require them
         in case of emergency for a short time, and that the risk must be run. I
         did not contemplate, however, that you would take troops from the
         Egyptian Garrison until those sent specially for you were exhausted. How
         long will you require Maxwell's troops, and where do you intend to send
         them? They should only be removed from Egypt for actual operations and
         for the shortest possible time."</p>
      
      
      <p>We may read this cable wrong but it seems to us to embody a topsy-turvy
         tactic! To wait till one part of your forces are killed off (for that is
         the plain English of "exhausted") before you bring up the other part of
         your forces.</p>
      
      
      <p>It is not easy to know what to do. The very best we can do, it sometimes
         seems to me, is to keep quiet rather than add one iota to the anxieties
         of people staggering under a load of responsibilities and cares. In the
         good old days the Gordons fought in two decisive battles in two
         Continents within a few months and no one worried the War Office about
         drafts! The 92nd carried on--had to carry on; they fell to quarter
         strength--still they were the Gordons and they carried on, just as if
         they counted a thousand rifles in their ranks. Now, I am quite prepared
         to do that to-day-- if that is the policy . If that  were  the policy;
         not one grouse or grumble should ever cross my lips. But that is  not 
         the policy. Press and People believe a Division is a unit made up in
         scientific proportions of different branches and numbering a certain
         number of rifles. They are told so; the War Office keep telling them so;
         they believe it, and, in fact, it is an absolute necessity of this
         modern trench war that it should be so. Although the Gordons got no
         drafts  between the battle of Kandahar and the battle of Majuba Hill,
         they got six months'  rest ; which was even better. In those days, apart
         from sieges, a battle was an event, here it is the rest or respite that
         is an event. Even British soldiers can't stick day and night fighting
         for ever. The attack spirit begins to ebb  unless  it is fed with fresh
         blood. Whether <span class="person">K.</span>'s mind, big with broad views, grasps this new factor
         with which he has never himself come into personal contact, God knows.
         But for his sake, every bit as much as for my own, it is up to me to
         keep hammering, hammering, hammering at drafts, drafts, drafts.</p>
      
      
      <p>Dined with the ever hospitable and kind hearted <span class="person">de Robeck</span> on  Triad .
         The Navy are still divided. Some there are who would wish me to urge the
         Admiral to play first fiddle in the coming attack. This  I will not do .
         I have neither the data nor the technical knowledge which would justify
         me to my conscience in doing so.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 4th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Have been out seeing the New Army at work.
         Some of the XIth Division were practising boat work in the evening and
         afterwards a Brigade started upon a night march into the mountains. The
         men are fit, although just beginning to be infected with the Eastern
         Mediterranean stomach trouble; i.e., the so-called cholera, which saved
         Constantinople from the Bulgarians in the last war.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 5th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> The day so longed for is very near now. O
         that it had come at the period of our victories! But there is time
         enough still, and the first moves of the plan are working smooth as
         oiled machinery. For the past few nights there has been steady flow
         into Anzac of troops, including a Division of the New Army. This has
         taken place, without any kind of hitch, under the very noses of the
         Turkish Army who have no inkling of the manoeuvre--as yet! The Navy
         are helping us admirably here with their organization and good sea
         discipline. Also, from what they tell me, Shaw and the <span class="unit">13th Division</span> of
         the New Army are playing up with the clockwork regularity of veterans.
         All this marks us up many points to the good, before even the flag
         drops. For, given the fine troops we have, the prime factors of the
         whole conception; the factors by which it stands or falls; are:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>(1) Our success in hoodwinking the Turks; i.e., surprise.</p>
      
      
      <p>(2) Our success in getting the <span class="unit">13th Division</span> and the Indian Brigade
         unnoticed into Anzac.</p>
      
      
      <p>(3) Our success in landing the Divisions from <span class="location">Imbros</span>, Lemnos and
         Mitylene, at moments fixed beforehand, upon an unknown, unsurveyed,
         uncharted shore of <span class="location">Suvla</span>. Of these three factors (1) and (2) may already
         be entered to our credit; (3) is on the knees of the Navy.</p>
      
      
      <p>The day before the start is the worst day for a Commander. The operation
         overhangs him as the thought of another sort of operation troubles the
         minds of sick men in hospitals. There is nothing to distract him; he has
         made his last will and testament; his affairs are quite in order; he has
         said  au revoir  to his friends with what cheeriness he can muster.
         Looking back, it seems to me that during two months every conceivable
         contingency has been anticipated and weighed and that the means of
         dealing with it as it may arise is now either:--embodied in our
         instructions to Corps Commanders, or else, set aside as pertaining to my
         own jurisdiction and responsibility. To my thinking, in fact, these
         instructions of ours illustrate the domain of G.H.Q. on the one hand and
         the province of the Corps Commander on the other very typically. The
         General Staff are proud of their work. Nothing; not a nosebag nor a
         bicycle has been left to chance.[1]</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Davies</span> and Diggle, his A.D.C., lunched and the Admiral came to haul me
         out for a walk about 6 p.m.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have written <span class="person">K.</span> by this evening's Mail bag about the sickness of the
         Australians, and indeed of all the troops here, excepting only the
         native Indian troops, and also about our Medical  band-o-bast  for the
         battle. No question about it, the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> was the theatre of all
         others for our Indian troops.</p>

      <p>CHAPTER XV SARI BAIR AND SUVLA</p>
      
      
      <p> 6th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> O! God of Bethel, by whose hand thy people
         still are fed,--I am wishing the very rare wish,--that it was the day
         after to-morrow. Men or mice we will be by then, but I'd like to know
         which. <span class="person">K.</span>'s New Army, too! How will they do? What do they think? They
         speak--and with justice--of the spirit of the Commander colouring the
         moral  of his men, but I have hardly seen them, much less taken their
         measure. One more week and we would have known something at first hand.
         Now, except that the <span class="unit">13th Division</span> and the <span class="unit">33rd</span> Brigade gained good
         opinions at <span class="location">Helles</span>, all is guess work.</p>
      
      
      <p>Went down to "K" Beach to see the <span class="unit">11th Division</span> go off. Young Brodrick,
         who was with us, proved himself much all there on the crowded pier and
         foreshore; very observant; telling me who or what I had not noticed,
         etc. First the destroyers were filling up and then the lighters. The
         young Naval Officers in charge of the lighters were very keen to show me
         how they had fixed up their reserves of ammunition and water. Spent
         quite a time at this and talking to Hammersley and Malcolm, his G.S.O.
         (1); also to Coleridge, G.S.O. (2), and to no end of Regimental
         Officers and men. Hammersley has been working too hard; at least he
         looked it; also, for the occasion, rather glum. Quite natural; but I
         always remember Wolseley's remark about the moral stimulus exerted by
         the gay staff officer and his large cigar. The occasion! Yes, each man
         to his own temperament. Some pray before battle; others dance and drink.
         The memory of Cromwell prevails over that of Prince Rupert with most
         Englishmen but Prince Rupert,  per se , usually prevailed over Cromwell.
         To your adventurous soldier; to our heroes, <span class="person">Bobs</span>, Sir Evelyn, Garnet
         Wolseley, Charles Gordon (great psalm-singer though he was) an occasion
         like to-night's holds the same intoxicating mixture of danger and desire
         as fills the glass of the boy bridegroom when he raises it to the health
         of his enigma in a veil. But I don't know how it is; I used to feel like
         that; now I too am terribly anxious. Disappointed not to see <span class="person">Stopford</span>
         nor Reed. They were to have been there. Besides the men on the beetles
         there are men packed like herrings upon the decks of the destroyers. I
         had half a mind to cruise round in the motor launch and say a few words
         to them Elandslaagte fashion, but was held back by feeling that the rank
         and file don't know me and that there was too long an interval before
         the entry into the danger zone.</p>
      
      
      <p>The sea was like glass--melted; blue green with a dull red glow in it:
         the air seemed to have been boiled. Officers and men gave me the "feel"
         of being "for it" though over serious for British soldiers who always,
         in my previous experience, have been extraordinarily animated and gay
         when they are advancing "on a Koppje day." These new men seem subdued
         when I recall the blaze of enthusiasm in which the old lot started out
         of <span class="location">Mudros</span> harbour on that April afternoon.</p>
      
      
      <p>The  moral  of troops about to enter into battle supplies a splendid
         field of research for students of the human soul, for then the blind
         wall set in everyday intercourse between Commander and commanded seems
         to become brittle as crystal and as transparent. Only for a few
         moments--last moments for so many? But, during those moments, the
         gesture of the General means so much--it strikes the attitude of his
         troops. It is up to <span class="person">Stopford</span> and Hammersley to make those gestures.
         <span class="person">Stopford</span> was not there, and is not the type; Hammersley is not that type
         either. How true it is that age, experience, wisdom count for less than
         youth, magnetism and love of danger when inexperience has to be
         heartened for the struggle.</p>
      
      
      <p>Strolled back slowly along the beach, and, at 8.30, in the gathering
         dusk, saw the whole flotilla glide away and disappear ghostlike to the
         Northwards. The empty harbour frightens me. Nothing in legend stranger
         or more terrible than the silent departure of this silent Army, <span class="person">K.</span>'s new
         Corps, every mother's son of them, face to face with their fate.</p>
      
      
      <p>But it will never do to begin the night's vigil in this low key. Capital
         news from the aeroplanes. Samson has sent in photographs taken
         yesterday, showing the <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay area. Not more than 100 to 150 yards
         of trenches in all; half a dozen gun emplacements and, the attached
         report adds, no Turks anywhere on the move.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 7th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Sitting in my hut after a night in the G.S.
         tent. One A.D.C. remains over there. As the cables come in he runs
         across with them. Freddie <span class="person">Maitland</span> runs fast. I am watching to see his
         helmet top the ridge of sand that lies between. The <span class="unit">9th Corps</span> has got
         ashore; some scrapping along the beaches but no wire or hold-up like
         there was at Sedd-el-Bahr: that in itself is worth fifty million golden
         sovereigns. The surprise has come off!</p>
      
      
      <p>I'd sooner storm a hundred bloody trenches than dangle at the end of
         this wire. But now, thank God, the deadliest of the perils is past. The
         New Army are fairly ashore. That worst horror of searchlights and of the
         new troops being machine gunned in their boats has lifted its dark
         shadow.</p>
      
      
      <p>At Anzac, the most formidable entrenchment of the Turks, "Lone Pine,"
         was stormed yesterday evening by the Australian 1st Brigade; a desperate
         fine feat. At midnight Birdie cabled, "All going on well on right where
         men confident of repelling counter-attack now evidently being prepared:
         on left have taken Old No. 3 Post and first ridge of Walden Point,
         capturing machine gun: progress satisfactory, though appallingly
         difficult: casualties uncertain but on right about 100 killed; 400
         wounded."</p>
      
      
      <p>At <span class="location">Helles</span> a temporary success was scored, but, during the early part of
         the night, counter-attacks have brought us back to "as you were."
         Fighting is going on and we ought to be pinning the enemy to the South
         which is the main thing.</p>
      
      
      <p>From <span class="location">Suvla</span> we have no direct news since the "All landings successful"
         cable but we have the repetition of a wireless from G.H.Q. IXth Corps to
         the Vice-Admiral at 7.58 a.m. saying, "Prisoners captured state no fresh
         troops have arrived recently and forces opposed to us appear to be as
         estimated by G.H.Q. Apparently one Regiment only was opposed to our
         advance on left."</p>
      
      
      <p>I have caused this cable to be sent to <span class="person">Stopford</span>:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"4.20 p.m. G.H.Q. to <span class="unit">9th Corps</span>. Have only received one telegram from
         you. Chief glad to hear enemy opposition weakening and knows you will
         take advantage of this to push on rapidly. Prisoners state landing a
         surprise so take every advantage before you are forestalled."</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 8th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Another night on tenter hooks: great news: a
         wireless from a warship to tell us the <span class="location">Suvla</span> troops are up on the
         foothills: two cables from <span class="person">Stopford</span>: many messages from Anzac and
         <span class="location">Helles</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>"2.12 a.m. IXth Corps to G.H.Q. As far as can be ascertained <span class="unit">33rd</span>
         Brigade hold line the sea about 91.I.9 to <span class="location">Suvla</span> East corner[2] of Salt

      <p>"5.10 a.m. IXth Corps to G.H.Q. <span class="location">Yilghin Burnu</span> is in our hands. No
         further information."</p>
      
      
      <p>Awful work at Lone Pine. Desperate counter-attacks by enemy, but now
         Birdie thinks we are there to stay. Bulk of Turkish reserves engaged
         there whilst <span class="person">Godley</span>'s New Zealanders and the new <span class="unit">13th Division</span> under
         Shaw are well up the heights and have carried <span class="location">Chunuk Bair</span>. Koja Chemen
         Tepe not yet; but <span class="location">Chunuk Bair</span> will do: with that, we win!</p>
      
      
      <p>At <span class="location">Helles</span> we have pushed out again and the <span class="unit">East Lancs</span> Division have
         gallantly stormed the Vineyard which they hold. The Turks are making
         mighty counter-attacks but their columns have been cut to pieces by the
         thin lines of the <span class="unit">Lancashire Fusiliers</span>. Neither from <span class="location">Helles</span> nor from the
         Southern area of Anzac are the enemy likely to spare men to reinforce
         Sari Bair or <span class="location">Suvla</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 11.30 I ordered the  Arno  for mid-day sharp. Then happened one of
         those aquatic incidents which lend an atmosphere all their own to
         amphibious war. Rear-Admiral Nicholson, in local naval command here, had
         ordered the  Arno  to fill up her boilers. Some hitch arose, some d--d
         amphibious hitch. Thereupon, without telling me, he ordered the
         Commander of the  Arno  to draw fires, so that, when my signal was sent,
         a reply came from the Rear-Admiral saying he was sorry I should be
         inconvenienced, but he thought it best to order the fires to be drawn;
         otherwise the boilers might have suffered. When, at a crisis, a boiler
         walks into the middle of his calculations, a soldier is simply--boiled!
         I could not altogether master my irritation, and I wrote out a reply
         saying this was not a question of convenience or inconvenience but one
         of preventing a Commander-in-Chief from exercising his functions during
         battle. I sent the signal down to the signal tent and about an hour
         later <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> came over and said he had taken it upon himself to
         tone it down.[3] Just as well, perhaps, but here I was, marooned upon an
         island!</p>
      
      
      <p>No other ship could be signalled. As a rule there was a destroyer on
         patrol about <span class="location">Helles</span> which could be called up by wireless, but to-day
         there was no getting hold of it. I began to be afraid we should not get
         away till dark when, at about 3.30 p.m. Nicholson signalled that the
         Triad  was sailing for <span class="location">Suvla</span> at 4.15 p.m., and would I care to go in
         her, the  Arno  following after she had watered. We were off like a
         shot, young Brodrick, Captain Anstey and myself for <span class="location">Suvla</span>. <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>
         remained to carry on with Anzac and <span class="location">Helles</span>. The moment I quit my post I
         drop out and he takes up the reins. His hands are capable--fortunately!
         To-day's cables before I left were right from <span class="location">Helles</span>; splendid from
         Anzac and nothing further from <span class="location">Suvla</span>.[4]</p>
      
      
      <p>As we sailed in, that bay, always till now so preternaturally deserted
         and silent, was alive and bustling with ships and small craft. A launch
         came along from the  <span class="location">Chatham</span>  and I jumped in whilst we were still going
         pretty fast and shot off to see <span class="person">de Robeck</span>. He seemed to think things
         naval were going pretty well and that Rear-Admiral Christian had been
         coping quite well with his share, but suggested that, as he was under a
         severe strain, I had better leave him alone. As to the soldiers' show,
         he said what Turks were on the ground, and there weren't many, had been
         well beaten--but--but-- but ; and all I could get him to say was that
         although he was well aware the fighting at <span class="location">Helles</span> and Anzac demanded my
         closest attention; still, that was in practised hands and he had felt
         bound to wireless to beg me to come up to <span class="location">Suvla</span> and see things for
         myself.</p>
      
      
      <p>Roger <span class="person">Keyes</span> said then that the landings had come off, on the whole, A.1.
         Our G.H.Q. idea, which the Navy had shared, that the whole of the troops
         should be landed South of <span class="location">Lala Baba</span> had been sound. The <span class="unit">33rd</span> Brigade had
         landed there without shot fired; the <span class="unit">32nd</span> had been sharply, but not
         very seriously opposed; the Brigade (the <span class="unit">34th</span>) which we, to meet the
         wish of the Corps, had tried to land for them opposite Hill 10 inside
         the Bay, instead of with the others as we had originally arranged, had
         only been able to find depth at the mouth of the Salt Lake; had suffered
         loss from rifle fire and had been thrown into disorder by the grounding
         of some lighters. The long wade through the water and mud had upset the
         cohesion of the Brigade.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Aspinall</span> now turned up. He was in a fever; said our chances were being
         thrown away with both hands and that he had already cabled me strongly
         to that effect. Neither the Admiral's message nor <span class="person">Aspinall</span>'s had reached
         me.[5]</p>
      
      
      <p>Not another moment was to be lost, so <span class="person">Keyes</span> took us both in his motor
         boat to H.M.S.  Jonquil  to see <span class="person">Stopford</span>. He (<span class="person">Stopford</span>) seemed happy and
         said that everything was quite all right and going well. Mahon with some
         of his troops was pressing back the Turks along Kiretch Tepe Sirt. There
         had been a very stiff fight in the darkness at <span class="location">Lala Baba</span> and next
         morning the Turks had fought so hard on a little mound called Hill 10
         that he (<span class="person">Stopford</span>) had been afraid we were not going to be able to take
         it at all. However, it had been taken, but there was great confusion and
         hours of delay in deploying for the attack of the foothills. They were
         easily carried in the end but by that time the men were so thirsty and
         tired that they did not follow up the beaten enemy.</p>
      
      
      <p>"And where are they now?" I asked.</p>
      
      
      <p>"There," he replied, "along the foot of the hills," and he pointed out
         the line, north to south.</p>
      
      
      <p>"But they held that line, more or less, yesterday," I said.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Yes," said <span class="person">Stopford</span>, and he went on to explain that the Brigadiers had
         been called upon to gain what ground they could without serious fighting
         but that, actually, they had not yet occupied any dominating tactical
         point. The men had been very tired; he had not been able to get water up
         to them or land his guns as quickly as he had hoped. Therefore, he had
         decided to postpone the occupation of the ridge (which might lead to a
         regular battle) until next morning.</p>
      
      
      <p>"A regular battle is just exactly what we are here for" was what I was
         inclined to say, but what I did say was that most of this was news to
         me; that he should have instantly informed me of his decision that he
         could not obey my cabled order of yesterday afternoon to "push on
         rapidly." <span class="person">Stopford</span> replied that he had only made up his mind within the
         past hour or so; that he had just got back from the shore and was going
         to send me a full message when I arrived.</p>
      
      
      <p>Now, what was to be done? The Turks were so quiet it seemed to me
         certain they must have taken the knock-out. All along the beaches, and
         inland too, no end of our men were on the move, offering fine targets.
         The artillery which had so long annoyed Anzac used to fire from behind
         <span class="location">Ismail Oglu Tepe</span>; i.e., within point blank range of where our men were
         now strolling about in crowds. Yet not a single shell was being fired.
         Either, the enemy's guns had been run back over the main ridge to save
         them; or, the garrison of <span class="location">Ismail Oglu Tepe</span> was so weak and shaken that
         they were avoiding any move which might precipitate a conflict.</p>
      
      
      <p>I said to <span class="person">Stopford</span>, "We must occupy the heights at once. It is
         imperative we get <span class="location">Ismail Oglu Tepe</span> and <span class="location">Tekke Tepe</span>  now !" To this he
         raised objections. He doubted whether the troops had got their water
         yet; he and Reed were agreed we ought to get more guns ashore; the
         combination of naval and military artillery was being worked out for the
         morning; orders would all have to be re-written. He added that, whilst
         agreeing with me on principle as to the necessity for pushing on, there
         were many tactical reasons against it, especially the attitude of his
         Generals who had told him their men were too tired. I thought to myself
         of the many, many times Lord <span class="person">Bobs</span>, French, every leader of note has had
         to fight that same  non possumus ; of the old days when half the victory
         lay in the moral effort which could impel men half dead with hunger,
         thirst and sleeplessness to push along. A cruel, pitiless business, but
         so is war itself. Was it not the greatest of soldiers who said his
         Marshals could always find ten good reasons for putting off an attack
         till next day!</p>
      
      
      <p>So I said I would like to see the G.O.C. Division and the Brigadiers
         personally so as to get a better grip of things than we could on board
         ship in harbour. <span class="person">Stopford</span> agreed; nothing, he said, would please him
         more than if I could succeed where he had failed, but would I excuse him
         from accompanying me; he had not been very fit; he had just returned
         from a visit to the shore and he wanted to give his leg a chance. He
         pointed out Hammersley's Headquarters about 400 yards off and said he,
         Hammersley, would be able to direct me to the Brigades.</p>
      
      
      <p>So I nipped down the  Jonquil's  ladder; tumbled into Roger <span class="person">Keyes</span>'
         racing motor boat and with him and <span class="person">Aspinall</span> we simply shot across the
         water to <span class="location">Lala Baba</span>. Every moment was priceless. I had not been five
         minutes on the  Jonquil  and in another two I was with Hammersley.</p>
      
      
      <p>Under the low cliffs by the sea was a small half-moon of beach about 100
         by 40 yards. At the North end of the half-moon was Hammersley. Asked to
         give me an idea of the situation he gave me much the same story as
         <span class="person">Stopford</span>. The 9th West Yorks and 6th Yorks had done A.1 storming Lala
         Baba in the dark. There had been marching and counter-marching in the
         move on Hill 10. The Brigadier had not been able to get a grip of his
         Battalions to throw them at it in proper unison and form. A delay of
         precious hours had been caused in the attack on <span class="location">Yilghin Burnu</span> by a
         Brigadier who wanted to go forward finding himself at cross purposes
         with a Brigadier who thought it better to hold back. At present all was
         peaceful and he expected a Staff Officer at any moment with a sketch
         showing the exact disposition of his troops. He could not, he feared,
         point me out the Brigade Headquarters on the ground. The general line
         held followed the under features of the hills.</p>
      
      
      <p>Malcolm, G.S.O.1, was then called and came up from the far end of the
         little beach. He was in the act of fixing up orders for next morning's
         attack. I told both Officers that there had never been a greater crisis
         in any battle than the one taking place as we spoke. They were naturally
         pleased at having got ashore and to have defeated the Turks on the
         shore, but they must not fly away with the idea that with time and
         patience everything would pan out very nicely. On the contrary, it was
         imperative, absolutely imperative, we should occupy the heights before
         the enemy brought back the guns they had carried off and before they
         received the reinforcements which were marching at that very moment to
         their aid. This was no guess: it  was  so: our aeroplanes had spotted
         Turks marching upon us from the North. We might be too late now; anyway
         our margin was of the narrowest.</p>
      
      
      <p>Hammersley assured me that sheer thirst, and the exhaustion of the
         troops owing to thirst, had been the only reason why he had not walked
         on to <span class="location">Ismail Oglu Tepe</span> last night. After <span class="location">Yilghin Burnu</span> had been
         carried, there was nothing to prevent the occupation of the heights as
         the Turks had been beat, but no one could fight against thirst.</p>
      
      
      <p>I asked him how the water question stood. He said it had been solved by
         the landing of more mules; there was no longer any serious supply
         trouble. All the troops were now watered, fed and rested. They had been
         told they should gain as much ground as they could without committing
         themselves to a general action, but they had not, in fact, made much
         progress. Thereupon, I pressed again my view that the Division should
         get on to the ridge forthwith. Let the Brigade-Majors, I said, pick out
         a few of their freshest companies and get on to the crest right now.
         Hammersley still clung to the view that he could not get any of his
         troops under weigh before daylight next morning. The units were
         scattered; no reconnaissance had been made of the ground to their front;
         that ground was jungly and blind; it would be impossible to get orders
         round the whole Division in time to let the junior ranks study them.
         Hammersley's points were made in a proper and soldierly manner. Every
         General of experience would be with him in each of them, but there was
         one huge danger rapidly approaching us; already casting its shadow upon
         us, which, to me as Commander-in-Chief, outweighed every secondary
         objection. We might have the hills at the cost of walking up them
         to-day; the Lord only knew what would be the price of them to-morrow.
         <span class="location">Helles</span> and Anzac were both holding the Turks to their own front, but
         from Asia and Bulair the enemy were on the march. Once our troops dug
         themselves in on the crest no number of Turks would be able to shift
         them. But; if the Turks got there first? If, as Colonel Malcolm said, it
         was impossible to get orders round the Division in time,--a surprising
         statement--was there no body of troops--no Divisional reserve--no
         nothing--which could be used for the purpose of marching a couple of
         miles? Seemingly, there was no reserve! Never, in all my long soldiering
         had I been faced with ideas like these. I have seen attack orders
         dictated to a Division from the saddle in less than five minutes. Here
         was a victorious Division, rested and watered, said to be unable to
         bestir itself, even feebly, with less than twelve hours' notice! This
         was what I felt and although I did not say it probably I looked it, for
         Malcolm now qualified the original  non possumus  by saying that
         although the Irish and the <span class="unit">33rd</span> and <span class="unit">34th</span> Brigades could not be set in
         motion before daylight, the <span class="unit">32nd</span> Brigade, which was concentrated round
         about Sulajik, would be ready to move at short notice.</p>
      
      
      <p>The moment had now come for making up my mind. I did so, and told
         Hammersley in the most distinct terms that I wished this Brigade to
         advance  at once and dig themselves in on the crestline .[6] If the
         Brigade could fix themselves upon the heights overlooking <span class="location">Anafarta Sagir</span>
         they would make the morning advance easy for their comrades and would be
         able to interfere with and delay the Turkish reinforcements which might
         try and debouch between the two Anafartas during the night or march down
         upon <span class="location">Suvla</span> from the North. Viewed from the sea or studied in a map there
         might be some question of this hill, or that hill, but, on the ground it
         was clear to half an eye that <span class="location">Tekke Tepe</span> was the key to the whole <span class="location">Suvla</span>
         Bay area. If by dawn, I said, even one Company of ours was well
         entrenched on the <span class="location">Tekke Tepe</span> height we should have the whip hand of the
         enemy in the opening moves next morning.</p>
      
      
      <p>Hammersley said he understood my order and that the advance should be
         put in hand at once. Malcolm hurried off; I left a little before 6.30
         and went,  via  the  <span class="location">Chatham</span> , back to the  Triad . The  Arno  had by
         now come in, but <span class="person">de Robeck</span> has kindly asked me not to shift quarters if
         Anzac and <span class="location">Helles</span> troubles will permit me to stay the night at <span class="location">Suvla</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>All was dead quiet ashore till 11 p.m. I was on the bridge until then
         and, seeing and hearing nothing, felt sure the Brigade had made good
         <span class="location">Tekke Tepe</span> and were now digging themselves in.</p>
      
      
      <p>Captain Brody dined. The scraps of news picked up from the sailormen,
         mainly by young Brodrick, confirm what the soldiers had told us about
         the landing inside <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay along the narrow strip of land West of the
         Salt Lake. The attacks on Hill 10 went to pieces, not against the Turks,
         but by mishap. The first assault made by one or two Companies succeeded,
         but the assailants were taken for Turks and were attacked in turn and
         driven off by others of our men. A most distressing affair.</p>
      
      
      <p>If there was hesitation and mix-up in the general handling, the
         Regimental folk atoned and there were many incidents of initiative and
         daring on the part of battalions and companies.</p>
      
      
      <p>Mahon with some of his Irish and a Manchester Battalion are fighting
         well and clearing Kiretch Tepe Sirt. Until this morning bullets from
         that ridge were falling on "A" Beach; now the working parties are not in
         any way disturbed.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 9th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> With the first streak of dawn I was up on
         the bridge with my glasses. The hills are so covered with scrub that it
         was hard to see what was going on in that uncertain light, but the
         heavyish shrapnel fire was a bad sign and the fact that the enemy's guns
         were firing from a knoll a few hundred yards East of <span class="location">Anafarta Sagir</span> was
         proof that our troops were not holding <span class="location">Tekke Tepe</span>. But the Officer of
         the Watch said that the small hours passed quietly; no firing ashore
         during the hours of darkness. Could not make head or tail of it!</p>
      
      
      <p>As the light grew stronger some of ours could be seen pushing up the
         western slopes of the long spur running out South-west from Anafarta.
         The scrub was so thick that they had to climb together and
         follow-my-leader along what appeared to be cattle tracks up the hill. On
         our right all seemed going very well. Looking through naval telescopes
         we thought--we all thought--<span class="location">Ismail Oglu Tepe</span> height was won. Very soon
         the shrapnel got on to those bunches of men on our left and there was
         something like a stampede from North to South. Looking closer we could
         see the enemy advancing behind their own bursting shrapnel and rolling
         up our line from the left on to the centre. Oh for the good "Queen
         Bess," her high command, and her 15-inch shrapnel! One broadside and
         these Turks would go scampering down to Gehenna. The enemy
         counter-attack was coming from the direction of <span class="location">Tekke Tepe</span> and moving
         over the foothills and plain on Sulajik. Our centre made a convulsive
         effort (so it seemed) to throw back the steadily advancing Turks; three
         or four companies (they looked like) moved out from the brush about
         Sulajik and tried to deploy. But the shrapnel got on to these fellows
         also and I lost sight of them. Then about 6 a.m., the whole lot seemed
         suddenly to collapse:--including the right! Not only did they give
         ground but they came back--some of them--half-way to the sea. But others
         made a stand. The musketry fire got very heavy. The enemy were making a
         supreme effort. The Turkish shell fire grew hotter and hotter. The
         enemy's guns seemed now to be firing not only from round about Anafarta
         Sagir, but also from somewhere between 113 and 101, 2,500 yards or so
         South-west of Anafarta. Still these fellows of ours; not more than a
         quarter of those on the ground at the outset--stuck it out. My heart
         has grown tough amidst the struggles of the Peninsula but the misery of
         this scene well nigh broke it. What kept me going was the sight of Sari
         Bair--I could not keep my eyes off the Sari Bair ridge. Guns from all
         sides, sea and land, Turks and British, were turned on to it and
         enormous explosions were sending slices off the top of the high mountain
         to mix with the clouds in the sky. Under that canopy our men were
         fighting for dear life far above us!</p>
      
      
      <p>Between 7.30 and 8.0 the Turkish reinforcements at <span class="location">Suvla</span> seemed to have
         got enough. They did not appear to be in any great strength: here and
         there they fell back: no more came up in support: evidently, they were
         being held: failure, not disaster, was the upshot: few things so bad
         they might not be worse. By 8.0 the musketry and the shelling began to
         slacken down although there was a good deal of desultory shooting. We
         were holding our own; the <span class="unit">Welsh</span> Division are coming in this morning; but
         we have not sweated blood only to hold our own; our occupation of the
         open key positions has been just too late! The element of
         surprise--wasted! The prime factor set aside for the sake of other
         factors! Words are no use.</p>
      
      
      <p>Looked at from the bridge of the  Triad --not a bad observation
         station--the tendency of our men to get into little groups was very
         noticeable: as if they had not been trained in working under fire in the
         open. As to the general form of our attack against the hills on our
         right, it seemed to be what our French Allies call  décousu . After a
         whole day's rest and preparing, there might have been more form and
         shape about the movement. Yet it was for the sake of this form and shape
         that the Turkish reinforcements have been given time to get on to the
         heights. Our stratagems worked well, but there is a time limit set to
         all make-believes; the hour glass of fate was set at forty-eight hours,
         and now the sands have run out.</p>
      
      
      <p>Before going over to Anzac I had to get hold of <span class="person">Stopford</span> so as to hear
         what news had come in from Hammersley and from Mahon. If only Mahon is
         pushing forward to <span class="location">Ejelmer</span> Bay and can occupy the high range to the East
         of it that would make amends for much. After breakfast, therefore, at
         8.30 got into a launch and landed at Ghazi Baba with young Brodrick as
         my only companion. Our boat took us into a deep, narrow creek cut by
         nature into the sheer rock just by Ghazi Baba--a name only; there is
         nothing to distinguish that spot from any other. Along the beach
         feverish activity; stores, water, ammunition, all the wants of an army
         being landed. Walking up the lower slope of Kiretch Tepe Sirt, we found
         <span class="person">Stopford</span>, about four or five hundred yards East of Ghazi Baba, busy with
         part of a Field Company of Engineers supervising the building of some
         splinter-proof Headquarters huts for himself and Staff. He was absorbed
         in the work, and he said that it would be well to make a thorough good
         job of the dug-outs as we should probably be here for a very long time.
         I retorted, "Devil a bit; within a day or two you will be picking the
         best of the Anafarta houses for your billet."</p>
      
      
      <p>From the spot he had selected the whole of <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay and the Salt Lake
         lay open; also the Anafartas and <span class="location">Yilghin Burnu</span>. But, being on a lower
         spur of Kiretch Tepe Sirt, his post was "dead" to the fighting taking
         place along the crest of Kiretch Tepe Sirt itself. I remarked on this
         and asked what news of the Irish, saying that now we were certainly
         forestalled at <span class="location">Yilghin Burnu</span> and, apparently, on <span class="location">Tekke Tepe</span> also, it was
         doubly essential Mahon should make a clean sweep of the ridge. <span class="person">Stopford</span>
         said he was confident he would be able to do so, aided as he would be by
         the fire from the ships in the harbour--a fire which enfiladed the whole
         length of this feature.</p>
      
      
      <p>As to this morning's hold up, <span class="person">Stopford</span> took it philosophically, which
         was well so far as it went, but he seemed hardly to realize that the
         Turks have rushed their guns and reinforcements here from a very long
         way off whilst he has been creeping along at the rate of a mile a day.
         <span class="person">Stopford</span> expected Hammersley would be in to report progress in person;
         he will keep me well posted in his news and he understands that the
         <span class="unit">Welsh</span> Division will be at his disposal to help the <span class="unit">11th Division</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>As <span class="person">Stopford</span> could give me no recent news from Mahon I suggested I should
         go and find out from him personally how matters then stood. <span class="person">Stopford</span>
         said it was a good idea but that he himself thought it better not to
         leave his Headquarters where messages kept coming in. I agreed and
         started with George Brodrick to scale the hill.</p>
      
      
      <p>About half a mile up we struck a crowd of the Irish Pioneer Regiment
         (Granard's) filling their water bottles at a well marked on the map as
         Charak Cheshme. In their company we now made our way Northwards along a
         path through fairly thick scrub as high as a man's waist. We were moving
         parallel to, and about 300 yards below, the crestline of the ridge. When
         we had gone another mile a spattering of "overs" began to fall around
         like the first heavy drops of a thunderstorm. So wrapped in cotton wool
         is a now-a-days Commander-in-Chief that this was the first musketry fire
         I could claim to have come under since the beginning of the war. To sit
         in a trench and hear flights of bullets flop into the sandbag parapet,
         or pass harmlessly overhead, is hardly to be under fire. An irregular
         stream of Irishmen were walking up the path along with us; one of them
         was hit just ahead of me. He caught it in the thigh and stretcher men
         whipped him off in a jiffy. At last we got to a spot some 2-1/2 miles
         from <span class="location">Suvla</span> and had not yet been able to find Mahon. So I sat down behind
         a stone, somewhere about the letter "K" of Kiretch Tepe Sirt, and sent
         young Brodrick to espy the land. He found that we had pulled up within a
         couple of hundred yards of the Brigade Headquarters, where portions of
         the 30th, 31st and <span class="unit">34th</span> Brigades (sounds very formidable but only five
         Battalions) were holding a spur and preparing to make an attack. General
         Mahon was actually in the Brigade Headquarters (a tiny ditch which only
         held four or five people) and came back to where I was sitting. He is
         angry, and small wonder, at the chaos introduced somehow into the Corps.
         He is commanding some of Hammersley's men and Hammersley has the bulk of
         his at the far extremity of the line of battle. He besought me to do my
         utmost to get Hill and his troops back to their own command.</p>
      
      
      <p>I told him G.H.Q. had always understood <span class="person">Stopford</span> would land his,
         Mahon's, two Brigades intact at A Beach. When the naval people could not
         find a beach at A, they, presumably with <span class="person">Stopford</span>'s concurrence, had
         most unluckily dumped them ashore several miles South at C Beach. This
         was the cause of the mix-up of his Division which <span class="person">Stopford</span>, no doubt,
         would take in hand as soon as he could. Mahon seemed in fighting form.
         He said he could clear the whole of Kiretch Tepe Sirt, but that he did
         not want to lose men in making frontal attacks, so he was trying to work
         round South through the thick scrub so as to shift the enemy that way.
         He had reckoned five or six hundred men were against him--gendarmes. But
         there were more than there had been at daylight. My talk with Mahon made
         me happier. Here, at least, was someone who had an idea of what he was
         doing. The main thing was to attack before more Turks came down the
         coast. My own idea would certainly have been to knock the Turks out by a
         bayonet charge--right there. So far they had not had time to dig a
         regular trench, only a few shallow scrapings along a natural fold of the
         ground. If Mahon wished to make a turning movement, then, I think, he
         would have been well advised to take it by the North where the ground
         over which he must advance was not only unentrenched and clear of brush,
         but also laid quite open to the supporting fire of the Fleet. But I kept
         these views to myself until I could see <span class="person">Stopford</span>; said good-bye to Mahon
         and wished him luck; found Brodrick had wandered off on his own to see
         the fun at close quarters; legged it, all alone, down the open southern
         slope of the Kiretch Tepe Sirt and got down into ground less open to
         snipers' fire from the scrub-covered plain.[7] Then, still quite alone,
         I made my way back South-west towards Ghazi Baba on <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay. After a
         little I was joined by two young Irish soldiers. I don't know who or
         what they took me for; certainly not for the Generalissimo. They came
         along with me and discussed identical adventures from diametrically
         different standpoints. One, in fact, was an optimist; the other a
         pessimist. One found fault with the war for not giving him enough
         hardship and adventure; the other was entirely fed up with adventures
         and hardships. This seems a trivial incident to jot down amidst issues
         so tremendous, but life is life, and my chat with these youngsters put
         some new life into me. Nearing the shore, I again struck <span class="person">Stopford</span>'s
         Headquarters, now beginning to look habitable. <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>, and one or
         two others of my Staff turned up from <span class="location">Imbros</span> at that moment. He shoved
         some cables into my hand and hastened off to interview Reed. <span class="location">Helles</span> and
         Anzac have been duly warned we are both here for a few hours; all the
         component parts of my machine, its cranks, levers, pulleys, are
         assembled at <span class="location">Imbros</span>, and G.H.Q. simply cannot be left under a junior
         much longer. Meanwhile I told <span class="person">Stopford</span> about Mahon and the gendarmes.
         When I said that the sooner the Kiretch Tepe nettle was grasped the less
         it would sting, he informed me he had issued an order that Commanders
         were not to lose men by making frontal attacks on trenches but were to
         turn them.</p>
      
      
      <p>So here is a theory which South African practice proved to be more often
         wrong than right being treated as an axiom at <span class="location">Gallipoli</span>!</p>
      
      
      <p>We next went into the question of digging a defensive line of trenches
         half-way between Corps Headquarters and Mahon's force. Here we were in
         accord. No man knows his luck and the tide may turn any moment. Both at
         Liao-Yang and the Shaho the Japanese began to dig deep trenches directly
         they captured a position.</p>
      
      
      <p>Young Brodrick rejoined me here; rather anxious at having lost me. He
         had found Mahon with the Brigade Staff. He had been shown the exact
         positions on a rough sketch map made by one of the Officers. We had
         three Battalions in the firing line and two in reserve. The gendarmerie
         had been reinforced and were now estimated at 700 without machine guns
         or artillery. We had a mountain battery shelling the gendarmes and a
         monitor occasionally gave them a big fellow. The Brigade Staff had said
         nothing to him about a battalion working round to the South. I repeated
         this to <span class="person">Stopford</span> and begged him to make a push for it here.</p>
      
      
      <p>By now <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> had finished with Reed, so we hurriedly discussed his
         budget of news. Hammersley is expected but he has not turned up yet.
         Indeed the situation is still by no means free from anxiety although the
         arrival of the <span class="unit">Welsh</span> Division gives confidence. A battalion of the <span class="unit">32nd</span>
         Brigade did get up on to <span class="location">Tekke Tepe</span> last night, it seems, but were
         knocked off this morning before they had time to entrench.[8] Seeing
         they should have had several hours time to dig in, that seems strange.
         <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> handed me a bunch of signals and wires; also the news of
         what I had known at the back of my mind since morning,--the fact that we
         had not got Sari Bair! Then we started back to see <span class="person">de Robeck</span> and <span class="person">Keyes</span>.
         For the first time in this expedition Roger <span class="person">Keyes</span> seemed down on his
         luck: we had often before seen him raging, never dejected. These awful
         delays:--delay in landing the Irish; delay in attacking on the 7th;
         delay all night of the 7th; delay during the day of the 8th and night of
         the 8th, have simply deprived him of the power of speech,--to soldiers,
         that is to say, though, to shipmates, no doubt...!</p>
      
      
      <p>Now for Anzac. Since dawn a fever about Anzac had held me. Shades of
         Staff College Professors, from you no forgiveness to a Chief who runs
         about the mountain quitting his central post. But the luminous shade of
         Napoleon would better understand my desperation. Some Generals are just
         accumulators of the will of the C.-in-C. When that is the case, and when
         they run down, there is only one man who can hope to pump in energy.</p>
      
      
      <p>Exact at noon Roger <span class="person">Keyes</span> and I pushed off in the racing motor boat. On
         our way we stopped at "C" beach and picked up Commander Worsley. Next to
         Anzac, but at the Cove, found that <span class="person">Birdwood</span> had left word he would meet
         me at the ex-Turkish Post No. 2,--so, as the water was shoal in spots,
         we rowed down there in a dinghy, along the shore where our lives would
         not have been worth half a minute's purchase just three days ago.</p>
      
      
      <p>After scrambling awhile over the new trenches, <span class="person">Birdwood</span>, <span class="person">Godley</span> and I
         sat down on a high spur above <span class="person">Godley</span>'s Headquarters which gave us a
         grand outlook over the whole <span class="location">Suvla</span> area, and across to <span class="location">Chunuk Bair</span>. Here
         we ate our rations and held an impromptu council of war; Shaw,
         commanding the new <span class="unit">13th Division</span>, joining in with us. All three Generals
         were in high spirits and refused to allow themselves to be damped down
         by the repulse of the morning's attack on the high ridge. They put down
         that check to the lethargy of <span class="location">Suvla</span>. Had <span class="person">Stopford</span> taken up any point on
         the watershed yesterday when it was unoccupied except by some fugitives,
         the whole Turkish position on the Peninsula would have become so
         critical that they could not have spared the numbers they have now
         brought up to defend "Q" and Koja Chemen Tepe. The Anzac Generals
         allowed that they themselves had got into arrears in their time tables,
         but they had been swift compared to <span class="location">Suvla</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Even as <span class="person">Godley</span> was holding forth, messages came to hand to say that the
         Turks were passing from the defensive to the offensive and urging fresh
         attacks on the New Zealanders holding <span class="location">Chunuk Bair</span>. <span class="person">Godley</span> is certain the
         Turks will never make us quit hold. Shaw, who also has some of his men
         up there, is equally confident. <span class="person">Birdwood</span> thinks <span class="location">Chunuk Bair</span> should be
         safe, though not so safe as it would have been had we held on to that
         ridge at "Q" where Baldwin's delay from causes not yet known, lost us
         the crestline this morning. Birdie said he could have cried, and is not
         quite sure he didn't cry, when the bombardment stopped dead and minute
         after minute passed away, from one minute to twenty, without a sign
         of Baldwin and his column who had been booked to spurt for the top on
         the heels of the last shell. Unaided, the 6th Gurkhas got well astride
         the ridge, but had to fall back owing to the lack of his support. None
         the less, these Anzac Generals are in great form. They are sure they
         will have the whip hand of the Narrows by to-morrow.</p>
      
      
      <p>Birdie was offered my last reserves, the <span class="unit">54th</span> Essex Territorials under
         Inglefield. But he can't water them. The effort to carry food, water and
         cartridges to the firing lines is already overtaxing the Corps. If
         Inglefield's men were also pushed in they simply could not be kept
         going. When communication trenches have been dug and brushwood and rocks
         flattened out, it will be easier. Till then, the Generals agreed they
         would rather the extra pressure was applied from <span class="location">Suvla</span>. <span class="person">Birdwood</span> and
         <span class="person">Godley</span> were keen, in fact, that the Essex Division should go to <span class="person">Stopford</span>
         so that he might at once occupy <span class="location">Kavak Tepe</span> and, if he could, <span class="location">Tekke Tepe</span>.
         All that the Anzacs have seen for themselves, or heard from their own
         extreme left or from aeroplanes, leads them to believe that the Turkish
         reinforcements to the <span class="location">Suvla</span> theatre came over the high shoulder of Tekke
         Tepe or through <span class="location">Anafarta Sagir</span> about dawn this morning and that the
         enemy are in some strength now along the ridge between <span class="location">Anafarta Sagir</span>
         and <span class="location">Ismail Oglu Tepe</span> with a few hundred on Kiretch Tepe Sirt: the
         Turkish centre was a gift to us yesterday; certainly yesterday forenoon;
         now it can only be won by hard fighting. But the Turks have not yet had
         time to work round on to the high ridges east of <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay and although
         a few Turks did pass over <span class="location">Kavak Tepe</span>, it seems to be now clear of any
         enemy. There is no sign of life on the bare Eastern slope of that
         mountain. Probably one half of the great crescent of hills which
         encircles the <span class="location">Suvla</span> plain and, in places, should overlook the Narrows,
         still lies open to an advance.</p>
      
      
      <p>So together we composed a message to <span class="person">Stopford</span> and <span class="person">Godley</span> sent it off by
         telephone--now rigged up between the two Corps Headquarters: the form
         was filled in by <span class="person">Godley</span>; hence his counter signature:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>  TO:--G.O.C., IXth Corps.</p>
      
      
      <p>  Sender's number. Day of month.  In reply to
         N.Z.G. 103            9         number AAA</p>
      
      
      <p>  After speaking to <span class="person">Birdwood</span> and <span class="person">Godley</span>
         think most important use fresh troops could
         be put to if not urgently required to reinforce
         would be the occupation as early as possible
         of the commanding position running through
         square 137-119 AAA <span class="location">Ismail Oglu Tepe</span> are
         less vital to security of base.
         SIR IAN HAMILTON.</p>
      
      
      <p>   From 
         Place  Fisherman's Hut.
         Date  2 p.m. 9th August, 1915.</p>
      
      
      <p>                              A. J. GODLEY,
         Maj. Gen.</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>Took leave of the Anzacs and the Anzac Generals about 4.30 p.m. The
         whole crowd were in tip-top spirits and immensely pleased with the
         freedom and largeness of their newly conquered kingdom. We of the G.H.Q.
         were bitten by this same spirit; <span class="location">Suvla</span> took second place in our minds
         and when we got on board the  Arno  the ugly events of the early morning
         had been shaken, for the moment, out of our minds. But, on the sail
         home, we were able to look at the Peninsula as a whole. Because the
         Anzacs, plus the <span class="unit">13th Division</span> of the New Army, had carried through a
         brilliant stroke of arms was a reason, not for shutting our eyes to the
         slowness of the <span class="location">Suvla</span> Generals, but for spurring them on to do likewise.
         There is nothing open to them now--not without efforts for which they
         are, for the time being, unfit--but <span class="location">Kavak Tepe</span> and the Aja Liman
         Anafarta ridge. So, on arrival at 6 p.m., wrote out the following
         message from myself to General <span class="person">Stopford</span>:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"I am in complete sympathy with you in the matter of all your Officers
         and men being new to this style of warfare and without any leaven of
         experienced troops on which to form themselves. Still I should be wrong
         if I did not express my concern at the want of energy and push displayed
         by the <span class="unit">11th Division</span>. It cannot all be want of experience as 13th have
         shown dash and self-confidence. Turks were almost negligible yesterday
         once you got ashore. To-day there was nothing to stop determined
         commanders leading such fine men as yours. Tell me what is wrong with
         the <span class="unit">11th Division</span>. Is it the Divisional Generals or Brigadiers or both?
         I have a first-rate Major General I can send at once and can also supply
         two competent Brigadiers. You must get a move on or the whole plan of
         operations is in danger of failing, for if you don't secure the AJA
         LIMAN ANAFARTA ridge without delay the enemy will. You must use your
         personal influence to insist on vigorous and sustained action against
         the weak forces of the Turks in your front, and while agreeing to the
         capture of W Hills and spur mentioned in C.G.S. letter to you of to-day,
         it is of vital importance to the whole operation that you thereafter
         promptly take steps to secure the ridge without possession of which
         SUVLA BAY is not safe. You must face casualties and strike while the
         opportunity offers and remember the AJA LIMAN ANAFARTA ridge is your
         principal and dominant objective and it must be captured. Every day's
         delay in its capture will enormously multiply your casualties. I want
         the name of the Brigadier who sent the message to say his left was
         retiring owing to a strong attack and then subsequently reported that
         the attack in question has never developed. Keep <span class="person">Birdwood</span> informed as he
         may be able to help you on your right flank."</p>
      
      
      <p>This message seemed so important that it was sent by hand of
         Hore-Ruthven and another Officer by special destroyer. <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> tells
         me that, when he was at <span class="unit">9th Corps</span> Headquarters to-day he showed General
         <span class="person">Stopford</span> the last two paragraphs of this memo which I had written when
         toning down the wording of a General Staff draft:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"C.G.S.</p>
      
      
      <p>"(1) I do not think much good rubbing it into these fellows, there are
         very few Turks opposed to them. We have done it, and that was right, but
         we must not overdo it.</p>
      
      
      <p>"(2) But the men ought to be made to understand that really the whole
         result of this campaign may depend on their quickly getting a footing on
         the hills right and left of Anafarta. Officers and rank and file must be
         made to grasp this.</p>
      
      
      <p>"(3) If <span class="person">Lindley</span> and his new men were kept intact and thrown in on the
         Anzac flank, surely they ought to be able to make a lodgment.</p>

      <p>Manifestly, the data in this cable were not enough to enable me to form
         any opinion of my own as to the credit due to anyone; but every soldier
         will understand that it was up to me to respond:</p>

      <p>"You and your troops have indeed done splendidly. Please tell Hammersley
         how much we hope from his able and rapid advance."</p>
      
      
      <p>I made no written note of this 10.50 a.m. cable (or of my reply to it)
         at the time and, eighteen months later, no mental note of it remained,
         probably because it had only added some detail to the news received
         during the night. But I had reason to regret this afterwards when I came
         to read the final Report of the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> Commission, paragraph 89.
         There I see it stated that "with regard to this message" (my pat on the
         back for Hammersley) "Sir Frederick <span class="person">Stopford</span> informed us that the result
         of the operations on the night of the 6th and day of the 7th was not as
         satisfactory as he would have liked but he gathered from Sir Ian
         Hamilton's congratulations that his dispositions and orders had met with
         the latter's approval"</p>
      
      
      <p>As to my actual feelings that forenoon, I do remember them well. At
         sunrise victory seemed assured. As morning melted into mid-day my mind
         became more and more uneasy at the scant news about the Irish Division
         and at the lack of news of a further advance of the <span class="unit">11th Division</span>. This
         growing anxiety drove me to quit my headquarters and to take ship for
         <span class="location">Suvla</span>.]</p>
      
      
      <p>[Footnote 5: The Admiral's wireless had said, so I was told:--"It is
         important we should meet--shall I come to Kephalos or are you coming to
         <span class="location">Suvla</span>?" As stated in text I did not get this cable at the time nor did I
         ever get it. Four years later the signal logs of the only ships through
         which the message could have passed; viz.,  Triad ,  Exmouth ,
         <span class="location">Chatham</span> , were searched and there is no trace of it. So I think it must
         have been drafted and overlooked.--IAN H., 1920.</p>

      <p>[Footnote 6: Looking to the distance of Sulajik, the Brigade might have
         been expected to move in about an hour and a half. But, as I did not
         know at the time, or indeed till two years later, this Brigade was  not 
         concentrated. Only two battalions were at Sulajik; the other two, the
         6th East Yorks and the 9th West Yorks, were in possession of Hill 70,

      <p>[Footnote 7: My Aide-de-Camp, George Brodrick, has permitted me to use
         the following extract from a letter of his written to his father, Lord
         Midleton, at the time.</p>

      <p>"I went to <span class="location">Suvla</span> with Sir Ian in the afternoon of August 8th, and we
         arrived to find 'Nothing doing.' The beaches and hillsides covered with
         our men almost like a Bank Holiday evening at Hampstead Heath. Vague
         shelling by one of our monitors was the only thing which broke the peace
         of a most perfect evening--a glorious sunset.</p>
      
      
      <p>"We went over to the Destroyer where General <span class="person">Stopford</span> had his
         Headquarters, and I fancy words of exhortation were spoken to him. We
         slept on the Triad, Admiral <span class="person">de Robeck</span>'s Yacht. I had a camp bed on the
         Bridge, so as to hear any happenings during the night. About dawn our
         Monitors started to shell the heights behind Anafarta and a sort of
         assault was made; the Turkish battery opened with shrapnel, and our
         fellows did not seem to get very far.</p>
      
      
      <p>"We went ashore on 'A' beach about 8 a.m. and walked up to <span class="person">Stopford</span>'s
         Headquarters, as he had gone ashore the night before. They all seemed a
         very lifeless crew, with but little knowledge of the general situation
         and no spirit in them. We made our way on across some rocky scrubby
         country towards Brigade Headquarters; fairly heavy rifle fire was going
         on, and after about two miles bullets began to ping unpleasantly all
         round us. I persuaded Sir Ian to lie down behind a rock, much against
         his will, and went on myself another 150 yards to where the Brigade
         Staff were sitting in a dip behind a stone wall. They told me that about
         800 Turks were in front of them with no machine guns. We had 3
         Battalions in the firing line and two in reserve and yet could not get
         on."]</p>

      <p>CHAPTER XVI KAVAK TEPE ATTACK COLLAPSES</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 10th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Had to remain at G.H.Q. all day--the worst
         of all days. My visit to <span class="location">Anzac</span> yesterday had infected me with the hopes
         of <span class="person">Godley</span> and <span class="person">Birdwood</span> and made me feel that we would recover what we
         had missed at <span class="location">Suvla</span>, and more, if, working from the pivot of Chunuk
         Bair, we got hold of the rest of Sari Bair.</p>
      
      
      <p>They believed they would bring this off and then the victory would have
         been definite. Now--<span class="location">Chunuk Bair</span> has gone!</p>
      
      
      <p>The New Zealand and New Army troops holding the knoll were relieved by
         two New Army Battalions and, at daylight this morning, the Turks simply
         ran amok among them with a Division in mass formation. Trenches badly
         sited, they say, and Turks able to form close by in dead ground. Many
         reasons no doubt and lack of swift pressure from <span class="location">Suvla</span>. The Turks have
         lost their fear of <span class="person">Stopford</span> and concentrated full force against the
         Anzacs. By Birdie's message, it looks as if the heavy fighting was at an
         end--an end which leaves us with a fine gain of ground though minus the
         vital crests. Next time we will get them. We are close up to the summit
         instead of having five or six hundred feet to climb.</p>
      
      
      <p>News from <span class="location">Suvla</span> still rotten. Here is the result of Hammersley's visit
         to <span class="person">Stopford</span> after I left:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>  "August 9.    5.35.    <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay.</p>
      
      
      <p>  "DEAR BRAITHWAITE,</p>
      
      
      <p>"I have had a talk with Hammersley and he tells me that his troops are
         much exhausted, have had very heavy fighting, severe losses and have
         felt the want of water very much. He does not consider that they are fit
         to make a fresh attack to-morrow.</p>
      
      
      <p>"I have decided after consultation with him to make an attempt on the
         ridge about Abrikja with three fresh Territorial Battalions and six
         which have been used to-day. I am afraid from what I hear that the Naval
         guns do not have much effect on account of difficulty of accurate
         observation but I will arrange a programme, to be carefully timed, with
         Brigadier-General Smith, my Brigadier R.A., and of course all the field
         guns will also help. I  must  see Smith so please ask the V. Admiral to
         place a boat at Smith's disposal to bring him here to see me and then to
         see Generals Hammersley and <span class="person">Lindley</span>. General <span class="person">Lindley</span> will be in
         immediate command of the operations as all troops engaged in the attack
         will be Territorials.</p>
      
      
      <p>"I trust the attack will succeed though to-day's did not, but in view of
         the urgency of the matter I feel the attempt ought to be made.</p>
      
      
      <p>"It is absolutely necessary that I should see Smith.</p>
      
      
      <p>                        "Yours sincerely,
         ( Sd. ) "FRED W. STOPFORD."</p>
      
      
      <p>At mid-day, got a cable from the <span class="unit">9th Corps</span> saying that <span class="person">Lindley</span>'s
         Division had duly gone at Hill 70, a key feature on the ridge, about
         1,500 yards North-east of <span class="location">Yilghin Burnu</span>--and had failed!</p>
      
      
      <p>In giving me this news, <span class="person">Stopford</span> proposes to make a second attack this
         afternoon with the same Division. Have caused <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> to cable:</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"Hear you propose attacking again. Chief doubts advisability with tired
         troops after morning's failure; if you agree consolidate where you are
         and rest and reorganize."</p>
      
      
      <p>In a letter from <span class="person">Stopford</span> in answer to my signal of yesterday from
         Fisherman's Hut, he says:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  "No. 1.    Date , Aug. 9.    Time , 4 p.m.</p>
      
      
      <p>   Place , <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay.</p>
      
      
      <p>  "To:</p>
      
      
      <p>  "DEAR SIR IAN,</p>
      
      
      <p>"I have received your message from Fisherman's Hut. Hammersley has not
         been able to advance to-day, but the Turks have been counter-attacking
         all day and he has had to put in one of the Territorial Brigades to
         prevent being driven back.</p>
      
      
      <p>"I quite realize the importance of holding the high ground East of <span class="location">Suvla</span>
         Bay, but as the Turks advance through the gap between the two Anafartas
         where all the roads are, it is absolutely necessary to keep sufficient
         troops between <span class="location">Anafarta Sagir</span> and <span class="location">Ismail Oglu Tepe</span>, as otherwise if I
         were to seize the high ground between <span class="location">Anafarta Sagir</span> and <span class="location">Ejelmer</span> Bay
         without securing this gap, I might find myself holding the heights and
         the Turks pouring down to the harbour behind me. I will bear what you
         say in mind, and if I get an opportunity with fresh troops of taking the
         heights whilst holding on tight to my right flank I will do so. I
         understand that one reason why it was necessary to go for Ismail Oglu
         Tepe was that if I did not hold the Turks there they would fire into the
         rear of <span class="person">Birdwood</span>'s troops attacking Hill 305.</p>
      
      
      <p>                              "I am, Sir,
         "Yours sincerely,
         ( Sd. ) "FRED W. STOPFORD."</p>
      
      
      <p>For myself I wish the Turks would try to pour down over that flat, open
         country by the Salt Lake to seize the beaches under the guns of the
         warships.</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>Well, we had <span class="location">Chunuk Bair</span> in our hands the best part of two days and two
         nights. So far the Turks have never retaken trenches once we had fairly
         taken hold. Have they done so now? I hope not. Birdie and <span class="person">Godley</span> are at
         work upon a scheme for its recapture. The Turks are well commanded: that
         I admit. Their Generals knew they were done unless they could quickly
         knock us off our <span class="location">Chunuk Bair</span>. So they have done it. Never mind: never
         say die. Meanwhile we have the East Anglian Division available
         to-morrow, and I have been over in the G.S. marquee working out ways and
         means of taking <span class="location">Kavak Tepe</span> which may also give us an outlook, more
         distant, but yet an outlook, on to the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 11th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Did not dare to break away from the wire
         ends. A see-saw of cardinal events between <span class="location">Suvla</span> and Anzac.</p>
      
      
      <p>A workable scheme of attack has now been put into such shape as to let
         <span class="person">Stopford</span> dovetail his Corps orders into it, and first thing sent him
         this cable:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"G.H.Q. to IXth Corps. General Commanding wishes <span class="unit">54th Division</span> Infantry
         to attack line <span class="location">Kavak Tepe</span> peak 1195.5. at dawn to-morrow after night
         march to foothills; G.S.O. proceeding with detailed instructions. See
         Inglefield, make arrangements and give all assistance possible by
         landing <span class="unit">53rd Division</span> Signal Company, water gear and tools. <span class="unit">53rd Division</span> Division becomes
         general reserve."</p>
      
      
      <p>At 4.30 p.m., a letter from <span class="person">Stopford</span> anent the failure of the <span class="unit">53rd Division</span>
         Division,--depressing in itself but still more so in its inferences as
         to the <span class="unit">54th Division</span>. He says these troops showed "no attacking spirit
         at all. They did not come under heavy shell fire nor was the rifle fire
         very severe, but they not only showed no dash in attack but went back at
         slight provocation and went back a long way. Lots of the men lay down
         behind cover, etc. They went on when called upon to do so by Staff and
         other Officers but they seemed lost and under no leadership--in fact,
         they showed that they are not fit to put in the field without the help
         of Regulars. I really believe that if we had had one Brigade of Regulars
         here to set an example both the New Army and Territorials would have
         played up well with them but they have no standard to go by."</p>
      
      
      <p>Worse follows, for <span class="person">Stopford</span> takes back his assurance given me after my
         cable of the 9th when he said, "given water, guns and ammunition, I have
         no doubt about our being able to secure the hills." He tells me straight
         and without any beating about the bush, "I am sure they" (the
         Territorials) "would not secure the hills with any amount of guns, water
         and ammunition assuming ordinary opposition, as the attacking spirit was
         absent; chiefly owing to the want of leadership by the Officers."</p>
      
      
      <p>Ignoring our <span class="location">Kavak Tepe</span> scheme, he goes on then to ask me in so many
         words, not to try any attack with the <span class="unit">54th Division</span> but to stick them
         into trenches.</p>
      
      
      <p>This letter has driven me very nearly to my wits' ends. Things can't be
         so bad! None of us have any complaint at all of the New Army troops;
         only of their Old Army Generals. <span class="person">Stopford</span> says the <span class="unit">13th Division</span> were
         not reliable when they were at <span class="location">Helles</span>, whereas now, under <span class="person">Godley</span> at
         Anzac they have fought like lions.</p>
      
      
      <p>Rushed off in this, the good tub  Imogene  (Lieutenant-Commander Potts).
         There the rushing ceased as she steamed along so slowly that we didn't
         get to <span class="location">Suvla</span> till 7 p.m. Walked up with <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> and Freddie to the
         <span class="unit">9th Corps</span> Headquarters. Saw <span class="person">Stopford</span>. Wrestled with him for over an
         hour; <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> doing ditto with Reed.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Stopford</span> urged that these last two Territorial formations sent out to us
         were sucked oranges, the good in them having been drafted away into
         France and replaced by rejections. He says he would have walked on to
         the watershed the first day had we only stiffened his force with the
         <span class="unit">29th</span> Division. There happened to be some pretty decisive objections but
         there was no use entering into them then. So I merely told him that the
         <span class="unit">9th Corps</span> and the Territorials being now well ashore we may be able to
         bring up the <span class="unit">29th</span>. No doubt--had we a couple of Regular Divisions
         here--British or Indian--at full strength--no doubt we could astonish
         the world. Having the <span class="unit">53rd Division</span> and the <span class="unit">54th Division</span>s, half-trained and at
         half strength, I tried to make <span class="person">Stopford</span> see we must cut our coats with
         the stuff issued to us. The <span class="unit">54th</span> were good last winter, and, even if the
         best have been picked out of them, the residue should do well under
         sound leadership: Inglefield was a practised old warrior, and would not
         let him down.</p>
      
      
      <p>There was nothing solid to go upon in crying down the credit of the <span class="unit">54th</span>
         beyond hearsay and the self-evident fact that they are half their
         nominal strength. To assume they won't put up a fight is a certain way
         of making the best troops gun-shy. We are standing up to our necks in a
         time problem, and the tide is on the rise. There is not a moment to
         spare. The Turks have reinforced and they have brought back their guns;
         that is true. Now they will begin to dig trenches--indeed they are
         already digging--and more and more enemy troops will be placed in
         reserve behind the Anafartas and to the East of the <span class="location">Tekke Tepe</span>--<span class="location">Ejelmer</span>
         Bay range. On the 10th the <span class="location">Helles</span> people reported that, in spite of
         their efforts to hold the Turks, they had detached reinforcements to the
         North. These extra reinforcements may arrive to-morrow at Anzac or on
         the Anafartas; but, for at least another twenty four hours, they will
         not be able to get round to the high ridge between Anafarta and <span class="location">Ejelmer</span>
         Bay. So far as can be seen by aeroplane scouting, this ridge is still
         unoccupied; certainly it is unentrenched.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Stopford</span> who, at first, was dead set on digging agreed to have a dart at
         <span class="location">Kavak Tepe</span>. He will throw the <span class="unit">54th</span> at it. He will turn out the <span class="unit">9th Corps</span>
         and, if chance offers, they will attack along their own front. His chief
         remaining ghost inhabits the jungly bit of country between <span class="location">Anafarta Ova</span>
         and the foothills. In that belt he fears the Turkish snipers may harass
         our line of supply so that, when the heights are held, we may find it
         hard to feed and water our garrison. The New Armies and Territorials
         have no trained counter-snipers and are much at the mercy of the skilled
         Anatolian shikarris who haunt the close country.</p>
      
      
      <p>So I suggested blockhouses on the South African system to protect our
         line where it passed through the three quarters of a mile or so of close
         country. The enemy artillery would not spot them amongst the trees. I
         promised him also one hundred picked Australian bushmen, New Zealand
         Maoris and Gurkhas to act as scouts and counter-snipers.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Stopford</span> took to this idea very kindly; has fixed up a Conference of 9th
         Corps and Territorial Generals early to-morrow morning to discuss the
         whole plan, and will make every effort to occupy <span class="location">Kavak Tepe</span> to-morrow
         night. <span class="person">Stopford</span> seemed in much better form to-night; I think he is more
         fit: there has been 24 hours' delay but by waiting that time Inglefield
         and the Essex will have the help of a body of first-class scouts--quite
         a luminous notion. <span class="person">Stopford</span>, himself, presides at to-morrow's
         Conference. Inglefield is a good, straight fellow, not so young as we
         were in South Africa, but quite all right.</p>
      
      
      <p>Boarded the  Imogene . Dropped anchor at 11 p.m. at <span class="location">Imbros</span>.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 12th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Last thing last night <span class="person">Stopford</span> promised to
         let me know the result of the conference to be held at his Headquarters,
         and upon the plans for the lines of supply. Sent him a reminder:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"G.H.Q. to IXth Corps. Have you arranged practical system for supplying
         troops in the event of <span class="location">Tekke Tepe</span> ridge being secured?"</p>
      
      
      <p>A cable from <span class="person">K.</span>:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"I am sorry about the Xth and XIth Divisions in which I had great
         confidence. Could you not ginger them up? The utmost energy and dash
         are required for these operations or they will again revert to trench
         warfare."</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">K.</span>'s disappointment makes me feel  sick ! I know the great hopes he has
         built on these magnificent Divisions and I know equally well that he is
         not capable of understanding how he has cut his own throat, the men's
         throats and mine, by not sending young and up-to-date Generals to run
         them. <span class="person">K.</span> in this, and this alone, is with Tolstoi. The men are
         everything; the man nothing. Have cabled back saying, "I am acting
         absolutely as you indicate by 'ginger'; I only got back at 11 last night
         from a further application of that commodity. As a result a fresh attack
         will be made to-morrow morning by the IXth Corps and the <span class="unit">LIVth</span>
         Division."</p>
      
      
      <p>As to the New Army I point out to <span class="person">K.</span> that "they are fighting under
         conditions quite foreign to their training and moreover they have no
         regulars to set them a standard": also, (and pray Heaven it is truth)
         "Everyone is fully alive to the necessity for dash, so I trust the
         attack of to-morrow will be much better done than were the two previous
         attempts."</p>
      
      
      <p>Hardly had my cable to <span class="person">K.</span> been despatched when <span class="person">Stopford</span> gives us a
         sample specimen of "dash" by his answer to my reminder. He wires:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"IXth Corps to G.H.Q. I foresee very great difficulty. The only system
         possible at first probably will be convoy under escort."</p>
      
      
      <p>Twelve hours ago, more or less, <span class="person">Stopford</span> had agreed that there was a
         difficulty which it was up to him to solve and that, at first, (i.e.,
         till blockhouses had been built) the system would be convoy under
         escort. We ask him what he had done, expecting to get the particulars
         worked out by his Staff after the conference of Generals, and this is
         the reply!</p>
      
      
      <p>Five minutes later, in came another wire giving the general situation at
         <span class="location">Suvla</span>; saying the <span class="unit">53rd Division</span> Division had failed to clear ground from which
         the right of the advance of the <span class="unit">54th Division</span> might be threatened, and
         that <span class="person">Stopford</span> wished to postpone his night march another four and twenty
         hours.</p>
      
      
      <p>So this is the result of our "ginger," and <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> or I must rush
         over to <span class="location">Suvla</span> at once. Meanwhile, tactics and <span class="location">Kavak Tepe</span> must wait.</p>
      
      
      <p>Wired back:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"In the circumstances the operation for to-morrow is postponed. Chief
         sending C.G.S. over now to see you."</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Braithwaite</span> went: is back now: has seen both <span class="person">Stopford</span> and Reed: has
         agreed (with a sad heart) on my behalf to the night march being put off
         another twenty four hours.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have had, therefore, to cable <span class="person">K.</span> again, shouldering the heavy blame of
         this further delay:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F. 545). From General <span class="person">Sir Ian Hamilton</span> to Earl Kitchener. After
         anxiously weighing the pros and cons, I have decided that it is wiser to
         wait another 24 hours before carrying out the general attack mentioned
         in my No. M.F. 543. <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> has just returned from the IXth Corps,
         and he found that the spirit and general organization were improving
         rapidly. A small attack by a Brigade, which promised well, was in
         progress. This morning the Xth Division captured a trench."</p>
      
      
      <p>The story of the <span class="location">Suvla</span> Council of War:--At first the Generals were for
         fighting. Inglefield, of the <span class="unit">LIVth</span>, who is told off for the attack, was
         keen. All he asked was, a clean start from <span class="location">Anafarta Ova</span>. If his Division
         could jump off, intact and fresh, from that well-watered half-way house,
         <span class="location">Kavak Tepe</span> was his. The <span class="unit">LIIIth</span> Division for their part agreed to make
         good <span class="location">Anafarta Ova</span>; to clear out the snipers and to hold the place as a
         base for the <span class="unit">LIVth</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>So at 10 a.m. <span class="person">Stopford</span> issued orders saying the <span class="unit">LIVth</span> must march off at
         4 p.m. moving East of <span class="location">Anafarta Ova</span>. Then,--when at last all seemed
         settled, in came a message from the G.O.C. <span class="unit">LIIIth</span> Division, saying he
         could not undertake to clear <span class="location">Anafarta Ova</span> of snipers and to hold it as a
         cover to the advance of the <span class="unit">LIVth</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Stopford</span> thereupon cancelled his first order, and, at 1.15 p.m., issued
         fresh orders directing the <span class="unit">LIVth</span> Division  to send in one of their own
         Brigades  as an advance guard to clear the ground up to a point East of
         <span class="location">Anafarta Ova</span>. <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> stayed at Corps Headquarters at <span class="location">Suvla</span> until
         this Brigade, the 163rd, was moving on <span class="location">Anafarta Ova</span> driving the snipers
         before them. Mahon, too, after sitting for three days where I left him
         on the morning of the 9th, has got tired of looking at the gendarmes
         and has carried their trenches by the forbidden frontal bayonet charge
         without much trouble or loss although, naturally, these trenches have
         been strengthened during the interval.</p>
      
      
      <p>Amidst these tactical miss-fires entered Hankey. He has had a cable from
         his brother Secretary, Bonham Carter, saying the Prime Minister wishes
         him to stay on longer and that <span class="person">Lord K.</span> would like to know if he can do
         anything to give an impetus to the operations. Hankey showed me this
         cable; also his answer:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"Reference your 6910. I am glad to stay as desired. The chief thing you
         could send to help the present operations would be more ammunition. For
         supplies already sent everyone is most grateful. It is also important
         that units should be kept up to strength.</p>
      
      
      <p>"As General Officer Commanding has already apprised you fully of the
         situation I have nothing to add."</p>
      
      
      <p>In the Gordons' Mess "a Marine" used to stand as synonym for emptiness.
         Asquith's "Marine"[9] is the reverse. Into two sentences totalling 27
         words he boils down the drift of hundreds of cables and letters.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 13th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Well, I must put it down. Worked till
         lunch. In the afternoon, left in H.M.S.  Arno  and sailed over to <span class="location">Suvla</span>
         to have a last look over the  band-o-bast  for to-morrow's twice
         to-morrowed effort. First, saw the Admiral and Commodore who are simply
         dancing with impatience. No wonder. Whether or no <span class="location">Kavak Tepe</span> summit
         gives a useful outlook on to the back of Sari Bair and the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>,
         at least it will give us the whip hand of the guns on the Anafarta ridge
         and save our ships from the annoying attentions they are beginning to
         receive. The sailors think too they have worked out an extra good scheme
         for ship and shore guns.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Stopford</span> then came aboard; in the mood he was in aboard the  Jonquil  on
         the 8th,--only more so! The Divisional Generals are without hope, that
         is the text of his sermon. Hopeless about to-night, or to-morrow, that
         is to say; for there are rosy visions and to spare for next week, or the
         week after, or any other time, so long as it is not too near us. There
         is something in this beats me. We are alive--we are quite all right--the
         Brigade of the <span class="unit">LIVth</span> sent on to Kuchuk <span class="location">Anafarta Ova</span> made good its point.
         True, one battalion got separated from its comrades in the forest and
         was badly cut up by Turkish snipers just as was Braddock's force by the
         Redskins, but this, though tragic, is but a tiny incident of a great
         modern battle and the rest of the 163rd Brigade have not suffered and
         hold the spot whence, it was settled, the attack on <span class="location">Kavak Tepe</span> should
         jump off. Nothing practical or tactical seems to have occurred to force
         us to drop our plan.</p>
      
      
      <p>But no; <span class="person">Stopford</span> and Reed count the <span class="unit">LIIIth</span> Division as finished: the
         <span class="unit">LIVth</span> incapable of attack; the rest of the IXth Corps immovable.</p>
      
      
      <p>If I accept; we have lost this battle. We are not beaten now--the men
         are not--but if I accept, we are held up.</p>
      
      
      <p>There is no way out. Whether there is any good looking back even for one
         moment, God knows; I doubt it! But I feel so acutely, I seem to see so
         clearly, where our push for Constantinople first began to quit the
         rails, that I must put it down right here. The moment was when I asked
         for Rawlinson or <span class="person">Byng</span>, and when, in reply, the keen, the young, the fit,
         the up-to-date Commanders were all barred, simply and solely that Mahon
         should not be disturbed in his Divisional Command. I resisted it very
         strongly: I went so far as to remind <span class="person">K.</span> in my cable of his own sad
         disappointment at Bloemfontein when he (<span class="person">K.</span>) had offered him a Cavalry
         Brigade and he returned instead to his appointment in the Sudan. The
         question that keeps troubling me is, ought I to have fought it further;
         ought I to have resigned sooner than allow generals old and yet
         inexperienced to be foisted on to me?</p>
      
      
      <p>These stories about the troops? I do not accept them. The troops have
         lost heavily but they are right if there were leaders.</p>
      
      
      <p>I know quite well both Territorial Divisions. I knew them in England
         that is to say. Since then, they have had their eyes picked out. They
         have been through the strainer and the best officers and men and the
         best battalions have been serving for months past in France. The three
         show battalions in the <span class="unit">54th</span> (Essex) Division are in France and their
         places have been taken by the 10th and 11th London and by the 8th Hants.
         Essex is good; London is good and Hants is good; but the trinity is not
         Territorial. The same with the Welshmen.</p>
      
      
      <p>Yet even so; taking these Territorials as they are; a scratch lot; half
         strength; no artillery; not a patch upon the original Divisions as I
         inspected them in England six months ago; even so, they'd fight right
         enough and keen enough if they were set fair and square at their fence.</p>
      
      
      <p>In the fight of the 10th the Welshmen were not given a chance. Sent in
         on a narrow front--jammed into a pocket;--as they began to climb the
         spur they caught it from the guns, rifles and machine guns on both
         flanks.</p>
      
      
      <p>We might still do something with a change of commanders. But I have been
         long enough Military Secretary both in India and at home to realize that
         ruthlessness here is apt to be a two-edged sword. You can't clap a new
         head on to old shoulders without upsetting circulation and equilibrium.
         Still, I would harden my heart to it now--to-night--were not my hands
         tied by Mahon's seniority. Mahon is the next senior--in the whole force
         he stands next to myself. Had not Bruce Hamilton been barred by the P.M.
         when I wanted to put him in vice <span class="person">Hunter-Weston</span> at <span class="location">Helles</span>, the problem
         would be simple enough. Even if I had not, at the outset, given that
         well-tried, thrusting old fighter the conduct of the <span class="location">Suvla</span> enterprise,
         at least I would have brought him in on the morning of the 9th instant
         quite easily and without causing any upset to anyone or anything. He
         ranks both <span class="person">Stopford</span> and Mahon and nothing would have been simpler than
         to let him bring up a contingent of troops from <span class="location">Helles</span>, when,
         automatically, he would have taken command in the <span class="location">Suvla</span> area. What it
         would have meant to have had a man imbued with the attack spirit at the
         head of this IXth Corps would have been just--victory!</p>
      
      
      <p>Anchored at 9 p.m. and, before going to bed, sent following cable:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"From General <span class="person">Sir Ian Hamilton</span> to Secretary of State for War.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The result of my visit to the IXth Corps, from which I am just back,
         has bitterly disappointed me. There is nothing for it but to allow them
         time to rest and reorganize, unless I force <span class="person">Stopford</span> and his Divisional
         Generals to undertake a general action for which, in their present frame
         of mind, they have no heart. In fact, these generals are unfit for it.
         With exceeding reluctance I am obliged to give them time to rest and
         reorganize their troops.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Though we were to repeat our landing operations a hundred times, we
         would never dare hope to reproduce conditions so favourable as to put
         one division ashore under cover of dark and, as the day broke, have the
         next division sailing in to its support. No advantage was taken of these
         favourable conditions and, for reasons which I can only explain by
         letter, the swift advance was not delivered,--therefore, the mischief is
         done. Until we are ready to advance again, reorganized and complete, we
         must go slow."</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 14th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Before breakfast, <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> brought me a
         statement of our interview of last night with <span class="person">Stopford</span>. He dictated it,
         directly he got back last night; i.e., about three hours after the
         event. I agree with every word:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"Notes of an interview which took place on board H.M.S.  Triad  between
         6 and 7 p.m. on the 13th August, 1915, between the General Commanding
         and Sir Frederick <span class="person">Stopford</span>, commanding <span class="unit">9th Corps</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p> Present :--</p>
      
      
      <p>  General <span class="person">Sir Ian Hamilton</span>, G.C.B., D.S.O., A.D.C.,
         Lieut.-General Hon. Sir Frederick <span class="person">Stopford</span>,
         <span class="person">K.</span>C.M.G., etc.,
         Major-General <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>, C.B.</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"Sir Frederick represented that the <span class="unit">9th Corps</span> were not fit to undertake
         an advance at the present moment. Questioned why, he replied that the
         losses had been considerable, that the disorganization of units was very
         great, and that the length of the line he had to hold was all too thinly
         held as it was. He stated that his Divisional Generals were entirely of
         the same opinion as himself; in fact, he gave us completely the
         impression that they were 'not for it,' but he only specifically
         mentioned Hammersley and <span class="person">Lindley</span>. He said water was no difficulty. He
         implied that the troops were getting better every day, and given time to
         rest and reorganize, he thought they would be able in time to make an
         advance. But he was very emphatic on the point that at present such a
         thing as an attack had practically no chance of success. He told us that
         the opposition in the centre about <span class="location">Anafarta Ova</span> could no longer be
         classed as sniping, but that it was regular opposition. But as he also
         told us that his landing was an opposed landing, I think perhaps that
         during the short time he has been on active service in this country he
         has not quite realized what opposition really means. But the salient
         fact remains that none of his Divisional Generals who would be employed
         in the attack thought that that attack would have any chance of success
         whatever. Indeed, he saw every difficulty, and though he kept saying
         that he was an optimist, he foresaw every bad thing that could possibly
         happen and none of the bright spots. It was a most depressing interview,
         but it left no doubt in the minds of the hearers that it would be quite
         useless to order an attack to be undertaken by a Commander and
         Divisional Generals whose hearts were confessedly not in it, who saw a
         Turk behind every bush, a battalion behind every hill, and a Brigade
         behind every mountain."</p>
      
      
      <p>At lunch time <span class="person">Lord K.</span> answered my last night's cable:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"If you should deem it necessary to replace <span class="person">Stopford</span>, Mahon and
         Hammersley, have you any competent Generals to take their place? From
         your report I think <span class="person">Stopford</span> should come home.</p>
      
      
      <p>"This is a young man's war, and we must have commanding officers that
         will take full advantage of opportunities which occur but seldom. If,
         therefore, any Generals fail, do not hesitate to act promptly.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Any Generals I have available I will send you."</p>
      
      
      <p>Close on the top of this tardy appreciation of youth, comes another
         cable from him saying he has asked French to let me have <span class="person">Byng</span>, Horne and
         Kavanagh. "I hope," he says, "<span class="person">Stopford</span> has been relieved by you
         already."</p>
      
      
      <p>Have cabled back thanking him with all my heart; saying I shall be glad
         of the Generals he mentions as "<span class="person">Byng</span>, Kavanagh and Horne are all
         flyers."</p>
      
      
      <p>Between them, these two messages have cleared the air. Mahon's seniority
         has been at the root of this evil. <span class="person">K.</span>'s conscience tells him so and,
         therefore, he pricks his name now upon the fatal list. But he did not
         know, when he cabled, that Mahon had done well. I shall replace <span class="person">Stopford</span>
         forthwith by <span class="person">de Lisle</span> and chance Mahon's seniority.</p>
      
      
      <p>De Robeck came over for an hour in the evening.</p>
      
      
      <p>Lord and Lady Brassey arrived in the  Sunbeam , together with two young
         friends. They have both of them shown great enterprise in getting here.
         The dear old man gave me a warm greeting, but also something of a shock
         by talking about our terrible defeat: by condoling and by saying I had
         been asked to do the impossible. I have  not  been asked to do anything
         impossible in taking Constantinople. The feat is perfectly feasible. For
         the third time since we began it trembled in the balance a week ago. Nor
         is the capture of <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay and the linking up thereof with Anzac a
         defeat: a cruel disappointment, no doubt, but not a defeat; for, two
         more such defeats, measured in mere acreage, will give us the Narrows. A
         doctor at Kephalos, it seems, infected them with this poison of
         despondency. In their  Sunbeam  they will make first class carriers.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 15th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> <span class="person">De Lisle</span> has come over to relieve <span class="person">Stopford</span>.
         He has got his first instructions[10] and is in close communication with
         myself and General Staff on the preparations for the next move which
         will be supported by the Yeomanry from Egypt and by some more artillery.
         I had meant to make time to run across to <span class="location">Suvla</span> to-day but <span class="person">Stopford</span> may
         wish to see me on his way to <span class="location">Mudros</span> so I shall sit tight in case he
         does.</p>
      
      
      <p>Cables to and from <span class="person">K.</span> about our new Generals. <span class="person">Byng</span>, <span class="person">Maude</span> and <span class="person">Fanshawe</span>
         are coming. A brilliant trio. All of the three <span class="person">Fanshawe</span> brothers are
         good; this one worked under me on Salisbury Plain. <span class="person">Maude</span> is splendid!
         <span class="person">Byng</span> will make every one happy; he never spares himself. <span class="person">K.</span> has agreed
         to let <span class="person">de Lisle</span> hold the command of the <span class="unit">9th Corps</span> until <span class="person">Byng</span> turns up.
         He wants Birdie to take over the control of the whole of the Northern
         theatre, i.e., Anzac and <span class="location">Suvla</span>. I must think over this. Meanwhile, have
         cabled back, "I am enchanted to hear <span class="person">Byng</span>, <span class="person">Maude</span> and <span class="person">Fanshawe</span> are
         coming--I could wish for no better men."</p>
      
      
      <p>Sent also following which explains itself:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"When I appointed <span class="person">de Lisle</span> to command temporarily the IXth Corps I sent
         the following telegram to Mahon:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"'Although <span class="person">de Lisle</span> is junior to you, Sir Ian hopes that you will waive
         your seniority and continue in command of the Xth Division, at any rate
         during the present phase of operations.'</p>
      
      
      <p>"To this Mahon sent the following reply:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"'I respectfully decline to waive my seniority and to serve under the
         officer you name. Please let me know to whom I am to hand over the
         command of the Division.'</p>
      
      
      <p>"Consequently, I have appointed Brigadier-General F. F. Hill to command
         temporarily the Division and have ordered Mahon to go to <span class="location">Mudros</span> to await
         orders. Will you please send orders as to his disposal. As Peyton is not
         due from Egypt till 18th August, he was not in any case available."</p>

      <p>"Personal. You will like to know that the <span class="unit">XIIIth</span> Division is said to
         have fought very well and with great tenacity of spirit. In many
         instances poor company leading is said to have been responsible for
         undue losses."</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 16th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> A great press of business. Amongst other
         work, have written a long cable home giving them the whole story up to
         date. Lots of petty troubles. <span class="person">Stopford</span> goes to <span class="location">Mudros</span> direct. <span class="person">De Lisle</span>
         makes a thorough overhaul at <span class="location">Suvla</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Glyn and Hankey both looked in upon me. It is a relief to have an
         outsider of Hankey's calibre on the spot. He said, "Thank God!" when he
         heard of <span class="person">K.</span>'s cable, and urged Birdie should be told off to take <span class="location">Suvla</span>
         in hand, in his stead. I suppose the G.S. have let him get wind of <span class="person">K.</span>'s
         identical suggestion. As I told Hankey, I have not yet made up my mind.
         But it would be an awkward job for Birdie with all the Anzacs to run,
         and no nearer <span class="location">Suvla</span> really--in point of time--than we are. Nor is he
         staffed for so big a business. Hankey has been too long away from
         executive work to realize that difficulty. But the decisive factor is
         this; that having been closely associated with him and with his work for
         a good many years, I know as Hankey cannot know, how much of his
         strength lies in his personal touch and presence:--spread his powers too
         wide he loses that touch. Felt the better for my talk with Hankey. He
         can grasp the bigness of what we are up against and can yet keep his
         head and see that the game is worth the candle and that it is in our
         hands the moment we make up our minds to pay the price of the
         illuminant.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have written to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff saying:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"I have just been through a horrible mental crisis quite different from
         the ordinary anxiety of the battlefield, where I usually see what I
         think to be my way and chance it. I refer to <span class="person">Freddy Stopford</span>. Here is a
         man who has committed no fault; whose life-long conscientious study of
         his profession has borne the best fruits in letting him see the right
         thing to do and how it should be done. And yet he fails when many a man
         possessing not one quarter of his military qualifications carries on
         with flying colours. For there is no use beating about the bush now and,
         simply, he was not big enough in character to face up to the situation.
         It overwhelmed him.</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"A month ago we had the Turks down, undoubtedly and, whenever we could
         get a little ammunition together, we were confident we could take a line
         of trenches. As for their attacks, it was obvious their men were not for
         it. Now their four new Divisions of fine fighting material seem to have
         animated the whole of the rest of the force with their spirit, and the
         Turks have never fought so boldly as they are doing to-day. They are
         tough to crack, but D.V., we will be the tougher of the two."</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 17th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> From his cable of the 14th, <span class="person">K.</span> seems
         prepared to see me relieve Mahon of his command. But Mahon is a fighter
         and if I give him time to think over things a bit at <span class="location">Mudros</span>, he'll be
         sure to think better. I am sure the wisest course to take, is to take
         time. A Lieutenant-General in the British Army chucking up his command
         whilst his Division is actually under fire--is a very unhappy affair.
         Lord <span class="person">Bobs</span> used to say that a soldier asked, for the good of the cause,
         to serve as a drummer boy under his worst enemy should do so not only
         with alacrity but with joy. <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> agrees with me that we must
         just take the responsibility of doing nothing at all and of leaving him
         quietly to cool down at <span class="location">Mudros</span>. Hill, who carries on, was the General in
         command at Mitylene when I inspected there; he is a good fellow; he was
         anxious to push on upon that fatal 7th August at <span class="location">Suvla</span> and everyone says
         he is a stout fellow.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have got the name of the doctor who upset the Brasseys with his yarns.
         He declares he only retailed the tales of the wounded youngsters whom he
         tended. No more to be said. He has studied microbes extensively but one
         genus has clearly escaped his notice: he has never studied or grasped
         the fell methods of the microbes of rumour or panic. Am I sure that I
         myself have not crabbed my own show a bit in telling the full story of
         our fight to <span class="person">K.</span> this afternoon? No, I am by no means sure.</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F. 562.) From General <span class="person">Sir Ian Hamilton</span> to Earl Kitchener. Have
         thought it best to lay the truth fully before you, and am now able to
         give a complete  résumé  of the past week's operations, and an
         appreciation of the situation confronting me.</p>
      
      
      <p>"In broad outline, my plan was to hold the Turks in the Southern zone by
         constant activity of French and VIIIth Corps, and to throw all the
         reinforcements into the Northern zone with the object of defeating the
         enemy opposite Anzac, seizing a new base at <span class="location">Suvla</span>, and gaining a
         position astride the narrow part of the peninsula. With this object, I
         reinforced General <span class="person">Birdwood</span> with the <span class="unit">XIIIth</span> Division, <span class="unit">29th Brigade</span>, Xth
         Division, and <span class="unit">29th</span> Indian Brigade, all of which were secretly dribbled
         ashore at Anzac Cove on the three nights preceding commencement of
         operations. This was done without arousing the suspicions of the enemy.
         Arrangements were made for the XIth Division to land at <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay on the
         same night as General <span class="person">Birdwood</span> commenced his attack. Meanwhile, the
         Turks were deceived by ill-concealed preparations for landings on
         Asiatic coast near Mitylene, at Enos, South of Gaba Tepe.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Following is detailed plan of operations:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"On the afternoon of 6th August the VIIIth Corps were to attack Krithia
         trenches, and simultaneously General <span class="person">Birdwood</span> was to attack Lone Pine
         trenches on his right front, as though attempting to break out in this
         direction. In this way it was hoped to draw the Turkish reinforcements
         towards Krithia and Gaba Tepe and away from Anzac's left and <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay.
         At 10 p.m. General <span class="person">Birdwood</span>'s main attack was to develop on his left
         flank, the Turkish outposts were to be rushed and an advance made in
         several columns up the precipitous ravines leading to <span class="location">Chunuk Bair</span> and
         the summit of Hill 305, which it was hoped might be captured before
         daybreak.</p>
      
      
      <p>"As soon as the high ridge was in our hands an advance was to be made
         down the Hill 305 to take in the rear the trenches on Baby 700 (see
         enlarged map of Anzac positions) and at the same time the troops in the
         original Anzac position were to attack all along the line in an
         endeavour to break out and hurl the enemy off the Sari Bair. Meanwhile
         the XIth Division was to commence landing 10.30 p.m. on 6th August, one
         brigade inside <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay, two brigades on shore to South were to seize
         and hold all hills covering Bay and especially <span class="location">Yilghin Burnu</span> and Ismail
         Oglu Tepe on which enemy were believed to have guns which could bring
         fire to bear either on back of General <span class="person">Birdwood</span>'s advance on Hill 305,
         or on <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay. The ridge from <span class="location">Anafarta Sagir</span> to Aja Liman was also to
         be lightly held. The Xth Division, less one brigade, was to follow XIth
         Division at daybreak and <span class="unit">LIIIth</span> Division was held in general reserve.
         The <span class="unit">LIVth</span> Division had not arrived and could not be employed in the
         first instance.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The moment <span class="person">Stopford</span> had fulfilled the above tasks, which, owing to the
         small number of the enemy in this neighbourhood and the absence of any
         organized system of trenches, were considered comparatively easy, he was
         to advance South-west through Biyuk Anafarta with the object of
         assisting <span class="person">Birdwood</span> in the event of his attack being held up.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Reliable information indicated the strength of the enemy about <span class="location">Suvla</span>
         Bay to be one regiment, one squadron and some Gendarmerie with at most
         twelve guns, and events have shown that this estimate was correct. It
         was also believed that the enemy had 36,000 in the Southern zone, 27,000
         against Anzac, and 37,000 in reserve. Also 45,000 near Keshan who could
         not arrive for three days and 10,000 on Asiatic shore.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The attack by the VIIIth Corps opposite Krithia took place as arranged,
         but was met by determined opposition. Some enemy trenches were
         captured, but the Turks were found in great strength and full of fight.
         They counter-attacked repeatedly on the night of 6th/7th, and eventually
         regained the ground we had taken. Prisoners captured stated that the
         Turks had planned to attack us that night in any case which accounts for
         their strength.</p>
      
      
      <p>"In the Northern zone General <span class="person">Birdwood</span>'s afternoon attack was successful
         and Lone Pine trenches were captured by a most gallant Australian
         assault. Throughout the day, and for three successive days the enemy
         made repeated attempts to recapture the position, but each time were
         repulsed with severe loss. At 10 p.m. the main advance on the left flank
         by the New Zealanders, <span class="unit">XIIIth</span> Division, <span class="unit">29th Brigade</span> and <span class="person">Cox</span>'s Brigade
         began, and in spite of stupendous difficulties, moving by night in most
         difficult country, all enemy's posts in foot of hills were rushed and
         captured up to and including Damakjelik Bair. The enemy was partly
         surprised, but his reinforcements were all called up, and this, coupled
         with the extreme difficulty of the country, made it impossible to reach
         the crest of the hill that day or the following. The position
         immediately below the crest, however, was reached, and on the morning of
         the 8th, after severe fighting, two battalions of the <span class="unit">XIIIth</span> Division
         and Gurkhas reached the top of Kurt Ketchede, and two battalions of New
         Zealanders established themselves on the crest of the ridge at Chunuk
         Bair.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Unfortunately, the troops on Kurt Ketchede were shelled off the ridge
         by our own gun fire, and were unable to recapture it; and 48 hours
         later two battalions of the <span class="unit">XIIIth</span> Division, who had relieved tired New
         Zealanders on <span class="location">Chunuk Bair</span>, were driven back by determined daybreak
         assault, carried by the Turks in many successive lines, shoulder to
         shoulder. Our troops were too weary, and much too disorganized to make a
         counter-attack at that time, and could only maintain positions below
         crest. Water supply, which had always been an anxiety, began to fail,
         and grave difficulties arose which prevented the possibility of
         reinforcing <span class="person">Birdwood</span>, and almost necessitated our giving up our gains.
         All this, however, has now been put right.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Meanwhile, <span class="person">Stopford</span>'s Corps at <span class="location">Suvla</span> had landed most successfully, but,
         owing to lack of energy and determination on the part of leaders, and,
         perhaps, partly to the inexperience of the troops, had failed to take
         advantage of the opportunities as already reported.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The result is that my coup has so far failed. It was soon realized that
         it was necessary to give impetus to the IXth Corps, and the <span class="unit">LIIIth</span>
         Division was put in on 8th-9th. By this time the <span class="unit">LIVth</span> Division was
         available as general reserve. Unfortunately, the <span class="unit">LIIIth</span> Division broke
         in my hand, leaving me like a fencer with rapier broken, and by the time
         the <span class="unit">LIVth</span> Division arrived the remaining troops of the Corps were too
         tired and disorganized for further immediate effort.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The IXth Corps holds the position from Kiretch Tepe Sirt, bench mark 2;
         Sulajik; <span class="location">Yilghin Burnu</span>, with right flank thrown south to connect with
         <span class="person">Birdwood</span> at Kazlar Chair. <span class="person">Godley</span> has picket between Kazlar Chair and
         Damakjelik Bair, whence his line runs South-east to the spur South of
         Abdel Rahman Bair, thence South-west to square 80 D, South-east again to
         within 300 yards of Point 161 on <span class="location">Chunuk Bair</span>, and thence back to the
         left of the Anzac position.</p>
      
      
      <p>"<span class="person">De Lisle</span> has at his disposal the Xth Division, less one brigade, the
         XIth, <span class="unit">LIIIth</span> and <span class="unit">LIVth</span> Divisions; total rifles, owing to casualties,
         under 30,000. The <span class="location">Suvla</span> losses have been too severe considering extent
         and nature of the fighting that has taken place, and can only be
         attributed to the inexperience of the troops and their leaders, and the
         daring way in which the enemy skirmishers presumed upon it in the broken
         and wooded country. <span class="person">Birdwood</span> has lost about 13,000 since the action
         began, and has now available some 25,000 rifles. The VIIIth Corps has
         23,000 rifles, and the French 17,000 rifles.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The Turks have continued to be most active in the South, no doubt with
         the object of preventing us moving troops, but apparently they have now
         no more than 35,000 in this zone. The majority of the enemy Commander's
         troops are against Anzac and in reserve in the valley between Hills 305
         and 261, his strategic flank.</p>
      
      
      <p>"In the Northern zone, in the fighting line at <span class="location">Suvla</span> and Anzac and in
         reserve he may now have in all 75,000, and can either reinforce Hill 305
         or issue through the gap between the two Anafartas to oppose any attack
         on <span class="location">Ismail Oglu Tepe</span> or on the ridge running thence to <span class="location">Anafarta Sagir</span>. He
         has guns on Hill 305, on <span class="location">Ismail Oglu Tepe</span>, and on the ridge North of
         <span class="location">Anafarta Sagir</span> from which he can shell landing places at <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay, but
         is not holding the latter ridge in strength, nor do I think he has
         enough troops to enable him to do so.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The position regarding the Turkish reinforcements from Keshan is not
         clear. Only small parties have been located by aeroplanes marching
         South, and it appears that either this information was incorrect or that
         the enemy's forces had already got as far as the peninsula before
         fighting began.</p>
      
      
      <p>"I consider it urgently necessary to seize <span class="location">Ismail Oglu Tepe</span> and Anafarta
         Sagir at the earliest possible moment, and I have ordered <span class="person">de Lisle</span> to
         make the attempt at the earliest opportunity. I have also ordered
         <span class="person">Birdwood</span> to make a fresh attack on Hill 305 as soon as troops are
         reorganized and the difficulties of water supply solved, but for this he
         will require drafts and fresh troops. I have great hopes that these
         attacks may yet be successful, but it is impossible to disguise the fact
         that owing to the failure of the IXth Corps to take advantage of
         opportunities and the fact that surprise may now be absent, and that the
         enemy is prepared and in much greater strength, my difficulties are
         enormously increased. In any case my cadres will be so depleted as a
         result of action that I shall need large reinforcements to enable me to
         bring the operations to a happy conclusion.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The Turkish losses have been heavier than ours, and the total number of
         prisoners taken is 702, but I estimate that they have now in the
         peninsula at least 110,000 rifles to my 95,000 and they have all the
         advantage of position. They have, apparently, all the ammunition they
         need and obtain reinforcements as they are wanted. In particular, we
         have had no news of the arrival of the 45,000 troops reported to be at
         Keshan, and only one of the Asiatic Divisions has as yet come over. I
         had hoped that their reinforcements would be of poor quality and not a
         match for ours but this is not the case, and unfortunately the Turks
         have temporarily gained the moral ascendency over some of our new
         troops. If, therefore, this campaign is to be brought to an early and
         successful conclusion large reinforcements will have to be sent to
         me--drafts for the formations already here, and new formations with
         considerably reduced proportion of artillery. It has become a question
         of who can slog longest and hardest.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Owing to the difficulty of carrying on a winter campaign, and the
         lateness of the season, these troops should be sent immediately. My
         British Divisions are at present 45,000 under establishment, exclusive
         of about 9,000 promised or on the way. If this deficit were made up, and
         new formations totalling 50,000 rifles sent out as well, these, with the
         60,000 rifles which I estimate I shall have at the time of their
         arrival, should give me the necessary superiority, unless the absence of
         other enemies allows the Turks to bring up large additional
         reinforcements.</p>
      
      
      <p>"I hope you will realize how nearly this operation was a success
         complete beyond anticipation. The surprise was complete, and the army
         was thrown ashore in record time, practically without loss, and a little
         more push on the part of the IXth Corps would have relieved the pressure
         on Anzac, facilitated the retention of <span class="location">Chunuk Bair</span>, secured <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay as
         a port, and threatened the enemy's right in a way that should have
         enabled Anzac to turn a success into a great victory.</p>
      
      
      <p>"We are up against the Turkish Army which is well commanded and fighting
         bravely."</p>
      
      
      <p>After all's said and done the troops at <span class="location">Helles</span> and Anzac are still
         perfectly game and we have got nearer our goal. We started forth to:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>(1) Seize <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay;</p>
      
      
      <p>(2) Break out of Anzac and join on to <span class="location">Suvla</span>;</p>
      
      
      <p>(3) Seize Sari Bair crestline;</p>
      
      
      <p>(4) Hold enough of the hinterland of <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay to make it a comfortable
         harbour.</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>(1) and (2) we have carried through handsomely. We have trebled our
         holding at Anzac and we have put <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay in our pocket. (3) we have
         not done; we are short of it by a couple of hundred yards; (4) we have
         not done; it is a practicable harbour but subject certainly to
         annoyance. In honest, gambler's language, we have won a good stake but
         we have not broke the Ottoman Bank.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">De Lisle</span> reports confusion throughout <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay area. He  must  have
         three or four days to pull the troops together before he organizes a
         fresh offensive. The IXth Corps has been  un corps sans tête .</p>

      <p>CHAPTER XVII THE LAST BATTLE
         </p>
      
      <p> 18th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Freddie and I left in the  Arno  this
         morning; <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> and his boy Val came with us. We sailed for <span class="location">Suvla</span>
         via  Anzac and held a meeting which was nearer a Council of War than
         anything up to date. <span class="person">Dawnay</span>, Deedes and Beadon stood by; so did Generals
         Skeen, Hammersley and Peyton. Reed, C.G.S., IXth Corps, was also
         present. The discussion of the steps to be taken within the next two or
         three days lasted an hour and a half. Every one who spoke had studied
         the data and the ground and there was no divergence of view, which was a
         comfort. Our attack will have as its objective the seizure of a foothold
         on the high ground. Anzacs will co-operate. As I explained to the
         Generals, we hardly dare hope to make a clean break through till drafts
         and fresh munitions arrive as the Turks now have had too long to dig in.
         But if we can seize and keep a point upon the watershed (however small)
         from which we can observe the drop of our shell, we can knock out the
         landing places of the Turks. At the end, I told them I had asked for
         95,000 fresh rifles, 50,000 in new formations, 45,000 to bring my
         skeleton units up to strength, adding, that if I was refused that help
         then I felt Government had better get someone cleverer than myself to
         put their Fleet into the Marmora. The Generals seemed satisfied with my
         demands and sympathetic towards my personal attitude.</p>
      
      
      <p>As to the coming attack, the tone of the Conference was hopeful. They
         agreed that the nut was hard for our enfeebled forces to crack, but they
         seemed to think that if we were once to get the enemy on the run, with
         the old <span class="unit">29th</span> Division and the new, keen Yeomanry on their heels, we
         might yet go further than we expected. One Brigade of the <span class="unit">29th</span> Division
         has been brought round from <span class="location">Helles</span> to put shape and form into the <span class="unit">53rd Division</span>
         Division. Peyton's men are to be attached to the Irish Division. There
         is a new spirit of energy and hope in the higher ranks but the men have
         meanwhile been aimlessly marched and counter-marched, muddled, and
         knocked about so that their spirit has suffered in consequence.</p>
      
      
      <p>No end of Yeomen on the beaches; the cream of agricultural England. Many
         of them recognized me from my various home inspections. Would like very
         much to have had a war inspection, but the enemy gunners are too
         inquisitive.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">De Lisle</span> tells me he has now been round every corner of <span class="location">Suvla</span> and that
         the want of grip throughout the higher command has been worse than he
         dared to put on paper. To reorganize will take several weeks; but we
         have to try and act within two or three days.</p>
      
      
      <p>Skeen told us that when the Turks stuck up a placard saying Warsaw had
         fallen, the Australians gave three hearty cheers.</p>
      
      
      <p>The chief trouble in making plans for the coming attack lies in the want
         of cover on, and for a mile inland of, the <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay beaches. The whole
         stretch of the flat land immediately East and South of the Bay lies open
         to the Turkish gunners. This is no longer a serious drawback if the men
         are holding lines of trenches. But when the trench system is not yet in
         working order, and they want to deploy, then it is so awkward a factor
         that I would have been prepared to turn the whole battle into a night
         attack. The others were not for it. They thought that the troops were
         not highly enough trained and had lost too many officers to be able to
         find their way over this country in the darkness. They are in immediate
         touch with the men: I am not.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Lindley</span> asked if he might walk with me to the Beach, and on the way down
         he told me frankly his Division had gone to pieces and that he did not
         feel it in himself to pull it together again. Very fine of him to make a
         clean breast of it, I thought, and said so: also advised him to put what
         he had told me into writing to <span class="person">de Lisle</span>, when we will relieve him and I
         promised for my part, to try and fit him with some honourable but less
         onerous job.</p>
      
      
      <p>On Hammersley's report, Sitwell, Brigadier of the <span class="unit">34th</span> Brigade, 11th
         Division, has just been relieved of his command.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 19th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Sat sweating here, literally and
         metaphorically, from morn till dewy eve. King's Messenger left in the
         evening. <span class="person">Altham</span> came over from <span class="location">Mudros</span>. He stays to-night and we will
         work together to-morrow when the mails are off my mind.</p>
      
      
      <p>Hankey dined and left with the King's Messenger by the  Imogene . He has
         been a real help. The Staff has never quite cottoned to the chief among
         us takin' notes, but that is, I think, from a notion that it is not
         loyal to <span class="person">Lord K.</span> to press the P.M.'s P.S. too closely to their bosom.
         From my personal standpoint, it will be worth anything to us if, amidst
         the flood of false gossip pouring out by this very mail to our
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> Committee, to the Press, to Egypt and to London Drawing
         Rooms, we have sticking up out of it, even one little rock in the shape
         of an eye-witness.</p>
      
      
      <p>A shocking aeroplane smash up within a few yards of us. A brilliant
         young Officer (Captain Collet of the R.F.C.) killed outright and three
         men badly hurt.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 20th August, 1915.  Stayed in my tent keeping an eye on to-morrow. Put
         through a lot with <span class="person">Altham</span>. Am pressing him to hurry up with his canteens
         at <span class="location">Helles</span>, Anzac and <span class="location">Suvla</span>. In May I cabled the Q.M.G. begging him
         either to let me run a canteen on the lines of the South African Field
         Force Canteen, myself; or, to run it from home, himself; or, to put the
         business into the hands of some private firm like the Mess and Canteen
         Company, or Lipton's, or Harrods or anything he liked. In South Africa
         we could often buy something. In France our troops can buy anything.
         Here, had they each the purse of Fortunatus, they could buy nothing. A
         matter this, I won't say of life and death, but of sickness and health.
         Now, after three months without change of diet, the first canteen ship
         is about due. A mere flea bite of £10,000 worth. I am sending the whole
         of it to the Anzacs to whom it will hardly be more use than a bun is to
         a she bear. Only yesterday a letter came in from Birdie telling me that
         the doctors all say that the sameness of the food is making the men
         sick. The rations are A.1., but his men now loathe the very look of them
         after having had nothing else for three months. Birdie says, "If we
         could only get this wretched canteen ship along, and if, when she comes
         she contains anything like condiments to let them buy freely from her, I
         believe it would make all the difference in the world. But the fact
         remains that at present we cannot count on anything like a big effort
         from the men who have been here all these months."</p>
      
      
      <p>De Robeck came over at 4 p.m., by formal appointment, to talk business,
         and deadly serious business at that! He has heard, by cable I suppose,
         that the people at home will see him through if he sees his way to
         strike a blow with the Fleet. He takes this as a pretty strong hint to
         push through, or, to make some sort of a battleship attack to support
         us. De Robeck knows that when the Fleet goes in our fighting strength
         goes up. But he can gauge, as I cannot, the dangers the Fleet will
         thereby incur. Every personal motive urges me to urge him on. But I have
         no right to shove my oar in--no right at all--until I can say that we
         are done unless the Fleet do make an attack. Can I say so? No; if we
         get the drafts and munitions we can still open the Straits on our own
         and without calling on the sister Service for further sacrifice. So I
         fell back on first principles and said he must attack if he thought it
         right from the naval point of view but that we soldiers did not call for
         succour or ask him to do anything desperate: "You know how we stand," I
         said; "do what is right from the naval point of view and as to what  is 
         right from that point of view, I am no judge."</p>
      
      
      <p>The Admiral went away: I have been no help to him but I can't help it.</p>
      
      
      <p>Hardly had he gone when <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> (who had heard what was in the wind
         by a side wind) came and besought me to try and induce the Admiral to
         slip his battleships at the Straits. All the younger men of war are
         dying to have a dash, he said. That's as it may be but my mind is clear.
         If a sailor on land is a fish out of water, a soldier at sea is like a
         game cock in a duckpond. When <span class="person">de Robeck</span> said on March 22nd he wanted the
         help of the whole Army that was quite in order. He would not have been
         in order--at least, I don't think so--had he said in what manner he
         wanted the Army to act after it had got ashore. We are being helped now
         by the Navy; daily, hourly: we could not exist without the Fleet; but it
         is not for me to say I think the battleships should or should not take
         chances of mines and torpedoes.</p>
      
      
      <p>Brodrick is quite seedy. We are all afraid he won't be able to stick it
         out much longer although he is making the most heroic efforts. In the
         morning I attended the funeral of young Collet, killed yesterday so
         tragically. A long, slow march through heavy sand all along the beach to
         Kephalos; then up through some small rocky gullies, frightfully hot,
         until, at last, we reached a graveyard. The congregation numbered many
         of the poor boy's comrades who seemed much cut up about his untimely
         end.</p>
      
      
      <p>The P.M. has answered my cable to <span class="person">Lord K.</span> asking for 45,000 rifles to
         fill up and for 50,000 fresh rifles. <span class="person">K.</span> is in France, he says, and I
         will have my answer when he gets back. The 5th Royal Scots are down to
         289 rank and file. I have just cabled about them. Something must be
         done. Certainly it must be "out" for that particular unit if they don't
         very soon get some men. The War Office still refer to them as a
         Battalion!</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 21st August, 1915.  Sailed for <span class="location">Suvla</span> about 1 o'clock with <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>,
         <span class="person">Aspinall</span>, <span class="person">Dawnay</span>, Deedes, <span class="person">Ellison</span>, Pollen and <span class="person">Maitland</span>. The first time I
         have set forth with such a Staff. Not wishing to worry <span class="person">de Lisle</span>, I
         climbed up to the Karakol Dagh, whence I got something like a bird's eye
         view of the arena which was wrapt from head to foot in a mantle of
         pearly mist. Assuredly the Ancients would have ascribed this phenomenon
         to the intervention of an Immortal. Nothing like it had ever been seen
         by us until that day and the cloud--mist--call it what you will--must
         have had an unfortunate bearing on the battle. On any other afternoon
         the enemy's trenches would have been sharply and clearly lit up, whilst
         the enemy's gunners would have been dazzled by the setting sun. But
         under this strange shadow the tables were completely turned; the outline
         of the Turkish trenches were blurred and indistinct, whereas troops
         advancing from the Ægean against the Anafartas stood out in relief
         against a pale, luminous background.</p>
      
      
      <p>As a result of our instructions; of conferences and of the war council
         we had got our plan perfectly clear and ship-shape. Everyone understood
         it. The <span class="unit">10th Division</span> was Corps reserve and was lying down in mass about
         the old Hill 10 in the scrub. We had to trust to luck here as they were
         under the enemy's fire if they were spotted. But very strict orders as
         to keeping low and motionless had been issued and we had just to hope
         for the best. The Yeomanry were also Corps reserve at <span class="location">Lala Baba</span> where
         they were safe. But when they advanced, supposing they had to, they
         would have to cross a perfectly open plain under shell fire. This was
         the special blot on the scheme but there was no getting away from it.
         There was no room for them in the front line trenches and communication
         trenches to the front had not yet been dug.</p>
      
      
      <p>As to the attack:--on the extreme right the Anzacs and Indian Brigade
         were to push out from Damakjelik Bair towards Hill 60. Next to them in
         the right centre the <span class="unit">11th Division</span> was to push for the trenches at
         Hetman Chair. On the left centre the <span class="unit">29th</span> Division were to storm the now
         heavily entrenched Hill 70. Holding that and <span class="location">Ismail Oglu Tepe</span> we should
         command the plateau between the two Anafartas; knock out the enemy's
         guns and observation posts commanding <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay, and should easily be
         able thence to work ourselves into a position whence we will enfilade
         the rear of the Sari Bair Ridge and begin to get a strangle grip over
         the Turkish communications to the Southwards. From the extreme left on
         Kiretch Tepe Sirt by the sea, to Sulajik where they joined the <span class="unit">29th</span>
         Division the <span class="unit">53rd Division</span> and <span class="unit">54th</span> Divisions were simply holding the line.</p>
      
      
      <p>Only the broad outline of the fighting was visible through the dim
         twilight atmosphere and I have not yet got any details. Our bombardment
         began at 2.30 and lasted till 3 p.m., very inadequate in duration but
         the most our munitions would run to. Then, to the accompaniment of quick
         battery salvoes of shrapnel from the enemy and a heavy rattle of
         musketry, the whole line from about a mile due East of the Easternmost
         point of the Salt Lake down to Damakjelik Bair, nearly two miles, began
         to stir and move Eastwards. We had the joy of seeing the Turks begin to
         clear out of the trenches on Hill 70, and by 3.30 p.m. it seemed as if
         distinct progress was being made: about that time it was I saw the
         Yeomen marching in extended order over the open ground to the South of
         the Salt Lake in the direction of Hetman Chair. The enemy turned a
         baddish shrapnel fire on to them, and although they bore it most
         unflinchingly, old experience told me that their nervous fighting energy
         was being used up all the time. If only these men could have been
         brought within charging distance, fresh and unbroken by any ordeal! But
         here was just one of the drawbacks of the battlefield and no getting
         over it.</p>
      
      
      <p>After a bit, I went down to <span class="person">de Lisle</span> and found him sitting on a little
         spur about fifty yards from his own Headquarters with one of his Staff
         Officers. He was smoking a pipe--quite calm. There is usually nothing to
         be said or to be done once our war dogs have been slipped. A soldier
         might as well try to correct the aim of his bullet after he has pulled
         the trigger! Whilst I was there we heard--probably about 4.30--that the
         <span class="unit">11th Division</span> had captured the Turkish first line trenches which run
         North and South of Hetman Chair. Real good news this. We were
         considerably bucked up. Climbed back to Karakol Dagh but, from that time
         onwards, could make out nothing of the course of the battle save that
         <span class="location">Ismail Oglu Tepe</span> was not yet taken. As to Knoll 70, it was completely
         shrouded in dust and smoke. Sometimes it seemed as if the Turkish guns
         were firing against it; sometimes we thought they were our own. Far away
         by <span class="location">Kaiajik Aghala</span> things looked well as many enemy shrapnel were
         bursting there or thereabouts showing our men must have got home. By
         6.30 it had become too dark to see anything. The dust mingling with the
         strange mist, and also with the smoke of shrapnel and of the hugest and
         most awful blazing bush fire formed an impenetrable curtain.</p>
      
      
      <p>As the light faded the rifles and guns grew silent. So I clambered down
         off my perch and went again to <span class="person">de Lisle</span>'s post of command where I found
         him still sitting. He had seen no more than I had seen. The bulk of our
         reserves had been thrown in. No more news had come to hand. All was
         quiet now. Our  rôle , in fact, was finished, and Marshall, the man on
         the spot, by now held our destinies in his hands. Firm hands too. The
         telephone was working all right and I told <span class="person">de Lisle</span> to try and get a
         message through to him quickly saying that I hoped he would be able to
         dig in and hold fast to whatever he had gained. I have no fears about de
         Lisle's nerve; nor of Marshall's.</p>
      
      
      <p>Went on board and sailed for Headquarters, through darkness made visible
         by the fires blazing on the battlefield. No shooting. Got on the wires
         and found no news from Anzac nor more from <span class="person">de Lisle</span>. Crossed backwards
         and forwards the best part of the night between my tent and the G.S.
         tent, but <span class="person">de Lisle</span> had heard nothing definite enough to report. Brodrick
         still has fever. Ruthven has been wounded.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 22nd August, 1915.  <span class="location">Suvla</span> gone wrong again; Anzac right. Left G.H.Q. at
         11 o'clock with <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>, Commodore <span class="person">Keyes</span>, Captain Phillimore,
         <span class="person">Aspinall</span>, Beadon, <span class="person">Freddy</span> and Val in the  Arno  and went direct to Anzac.
         There I picked up Birdie and heard the Anzac part of the battle. The
         Indian Brigade have seized the well at Kabak Kuyu, and that fine
         soldier, Russell, fixed himself into <span class="location">Kaiajik Aghala</span> and is holding on
         there tooth and nail. There was fighting going on there at the moment
         but Russell is confident. How delightful it is to have to deal with men
         who are confident!</p>
      
      
      <p>This success of old <span class="person">Cox</span>'s is worth anything. The well alone, I suppose,
         might be valued at twenty or thirty thousand a year seeing it gives us
         beautiful spring water in free gift from Mother Earth instead of very
         dubious fluid conveyed at God only knows what cost from the Nile to
         Anzac Cove. If we can only hold on to <span class="location">Kaiajik Aghala</span>, then the road
         between Anzac and <span class="location">Suvla</span> will be freed from the sniper's bullet.</p>
      
      
      <p>Went on to <span class="location">Suvla</span> and landed with all my posse, remaining in consultation
         with Corps Headquarters till 3.30.</p>
      
      
      <p>Our attack on Hill 70 and <span class="location">Ismail Oglu Tepe</span> has failed. The enemy has dug
         himself well in by now and, therefore, we depended far more on our gun
         fire than we did on the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th. Unfortunately, the
         bombardment seems to have been pretty near futile--not the fault of the
         gunners, but simply because, on the one hand, the mist interfered with
         the accuracy of their aim, on the other, shortage of shell prevented
         them from making up for inaccuracy by quantity. Then the bush fires seem
         to have come along in the most terrible fashion and interposed between
         our brave <span class="unit">29th</span> and the Turks. The ancient Gods fought against us
         yesterday:--mist and fire, still hold their own against the inventions
         of man. Last but not least, all are agreed the fine edge of the 11th
         Division has been at last blunted--and small wonder: there is no use
         attacking any more with the New Army until it has been well rested and
         refreshed with new drafts.</p>
      
      
      <p>So far <span class="person">de Lisle</span> has no clear or connected story of the battle. The <span class="unit">29th</span>
         Division say they were shouldered off their true line of attack by the
         <span class="unit">11th Division</span>, then driven in by the fire; the <span class="unit">11th Division</span>, on their
         side, say that the Yeomen barged into them and threw them off their
         line. Had we been able to dig in we would have made good a lot of
         ground. But Marshall, not showy or brilliant but one of my most sound
         and reliable soldiers, decided, although he knew my wishes and hopes,
         that the troops had got themselves so mixed up and disorganized that it
         would be imprudent. So orders were issued by him, on the battlefield, to
         fall back to the original line. There was neither use nor time to refer
         back to <span class="person">de Lisle</span> and he had to come to the decision himself. I am quite
         confident he will be able to give good reasons for his act. Many of the
         men did not get the order and were still out at daylight this morning
         when they were heavily attacked by the Turks and fell back then of
         themselves into their old trenches. Another case of "as you were." We
         have lost a lot of men and can only hope that the Turks have lost as
         many. I don't think for a moment they did, not at least in the <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay
         sphere, but <span class="person">Cox</span> and Russell claim to have accounted for a very great
         number of them in their first retreat and in their counter-attacks in
         the Southern sector of the battle.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 23rd August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Not one moment, till to-day, to weigh
         bearing of <span class="person">K.</span>'s message of the 20th instant,--the message sent me in
         reply to my appeal for 50,000 fresh troops and 45,000 drafts. In it <span class="person">K.</span>
         tells me that a big push is going to take place in the Western theatre,
         and that I "must understand that no reinforcements of importance can be
         diverted from the main theatre of operations in France." Certain named
         transports are carrying, he says, more troops to Egypt, and he hopes
         Maxwell will be able to spare me some. If we can't get through with
         these we must hang on as best we may.</p>
      
      
      <p>To-day it has been up to us to try and bring home to the Higher
         Direction the possible effects of trying to do two things at once; i.e.,
         break through in France and break through here. We are to stand aside
         for a month or so just when we have made a big gain of ground but not
         the decisive watershed gain; when the Turks, despite their losses in
         life, shell, trenches and terrain, are shaken only; not yet shattered.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">K.</span> sees all the Allied cards--we don't. But we do know our own hand. We
         know that our Navy have now come clean down on the Ægean side of the
         fence, and have determined once for all to make no attack on their own.
         We have the  feel  of the situation in our bones and it was up to us--I
         think  it was--to rub it in that although the British War Direction may
         decree that the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> are to hang on without further help,
         indefinitely, yet sickness is not yet under their high command, nor are
         the Turks.</p>
      
      
      <p>So <span class="person">Dawnay</span>, who is making a name for himself as a master of plain
         business diction, was told off to draft me an answer to the War Office
         which should remove as many beams as possible out of their optics. He
         overdid it: the whole tone of it indeed was despondent, so much so that,
         as I told <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>, a S. of S. for War getting so dark a presentment
         of our prospects would be bound to begin to think it might be better to
         recall the whole expedition. So I rewrote the whole thing myself:--</p>
      
      
      <p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F. 578). From General <span class="person">Sir Ian Hamilton</span> to Secretary of State for
         War. We will endeavour to do the best possible with forces at our
         disposal; we quite understand reason for your inability to send us
         reinforcements necessary to bring operations to a successful conclusion,
         and thank you for putting it so plainly. After the failure of the IXth
         Corps to take prompt action after landing I took immediate steps to
         persevere with plan in spite of absence of surprise and reinforced
         northern wing with 2nd Mounted Division from Egypt and XXIXth Division
         from Cape <span class="location">Helles</span>. These movements and the necessary reorganization of
         the IXth Corps formations which had become very mixed took time, so that
         I was not able to renew the attack until 21st August.</p>
      
      
      <p>"By then enemy positions in Ratilva Valley had been immeasurably
         strengthened and I was confronted with the difficulty that if I could
         not drive the Turks back between <span class="location">Anafarta Sagir</span> and Biyuk Anafarta my
         new line from right of old Anzac position to sea coast North-east of
         <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay would be more than I could hold with the troops at my
         disposal. It would thus be a case of giving up either Anzac Cove or
         <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay. Therefore, as a preliminary step to my fresh offensive I
         determined to mass every man available against <span class="location">Ismail Oglu Tepe</span> which
         position it was necessary for me to capture whether as a first step
         towards clearing the valley, or, if this proved impossible and I was
         thrown on the defensive, to secure comparative immunity from shell fire
         either for <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay or Anzac Cove.</p>
      
      
      <p>"<span class="person">De Lisle</span> planned the attack well. The <span class="unit">LIIIth</span> and the <span class="unit">LIVth</span> Divisions
         were to hold enemy from Sulajik to Kiretch Tepe Sirt, and XXIXth
         Division and XIth Division were to attack <span class="location">Ismail Oglu Tepe</span> with two
         Brigades of Xth Division and the IInd Mounted Division (5,000 rifles) in
         corps reserve. I arranged that General <span class="person">Birdwood</span> should co-operate by
         swinging his left flank to Susak Kuyu and <span class="location">Kaiajik Aghala</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The troops attacked with great dash and stormed the lower slopes of the
         hill in spite of strong entrenchments, but I regret to say they were not
         able to attain their objective nor even to consolidate the position
         gained and yesterday found the whole line back in their original
         trenches except the left of the Australians where one battalion of
         Gurkhas and new Australian Battalion continue to hold Susak Kuyu.
         Casualties not yet to hand, but I fear they amounted to some 6,000 in
         all. This renewed failure combined with the heavy total casualties since
         6th August, and the fact that sickness has been greatly on the increase
         during the last fortnight has profoundly modified my position, and as
         you cannot now give me further reinforcements it is only possible for me
         to remain on the defensive. Naturally, I shall keep on trying to harry
         the Turks by local attacks and thus keep alive the offensive spirit but
         it must be stated plainly that no decisive success is to be looked for
         until such time as reinforcements can be sent.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The total casualties including sick since 6th August amount to 40,000,
         and my total force is now only 85,000, of which the fighting strength is
         68,000. The French fighting strength is about 15,000. Sick casualties
         are becoming abnormal chiefly owing to troops other than late arrivals
         being worn out with hardship and incessant shell fire, from which even
         when in reserve they are never free. Where Anzac evacuated 100 a day
         they are now evacuating 500, where <span class="unit">Royal Naval Division</span> evacuated 10
         they are now evacuating 60. The result is that I have only some 50,000
         men in the North to hold a line from the right of Anzac to the sea
         North-east of <span class="location">Suvla</span>, a distance of 23,000 yards.</p>
      
      
      <p>"When there is no serious engagement, but only daily trench fighting,
         the average net wastage from sickness and war is 24 per cent. of
         fighting strength per month. The Anzac Corps, the XXIXth Division and
         the XLIInd Division are very tired and need a rest badly. Keeping these
         conditions in view, it appears inevitable that within the next fortnight
         I shall be compelled to relinquish either <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay or Anzac Cove, and
         must also envisage the possibility of a still further reduction of my
         front in the near future. Taking the first question of abandoning Anzac
         Cove and closing to the North, <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay is now netted and comparatively
         secure from torpedo attack. Further, it offers certain facilities for
         disembarkation in winter gales. It has, therefore, some decided
         advantages but though I should be able to hold it safely at present, it
         would present no facilities for further contraction of my line to meet
         the future wastage of my force. On the other hand, by retiring South of
         <span class="location">Suvla</span> I could first hold a line <span class="location">Lala Baba</span>--<span class="location">Yilghin Burnu</span>--Kaiajik
         Aghala, and then, when normal wastage diminished my strength below this
         limit I could, if necessary, withdraw into the original Anzac position.
         For these reasons it must probably be <span class="location">Suvla</span> and not Anzac which must be
         given up, though on account of its advantages as indicated above, and on
         account of the moral effect of retiring, you may rely on my not
         relinquishing it a single day before I am compelled.</p>
      
      
      <p>"I do not wish to paint a gloomy picture. It is a simple problem of
         arithmetic and measurement. On the basis of normal wastage and the
         present scale of drafts my total fighting strength by the middle of
         December, including the French, will be only, say, 60,000. Of this
         force, a certain percentage must of necessity be resting off the
         peninsula, and the remainder will only suffice to hold Cape <span class="location">Helles</span> and
         the original Anzac line unless, of course, the enemy collapses. Until
         now, however, the Turks replace casualties promptly, although frequently
         by untrained men. Also our other foe, sickness, may abate, but seeing
         how tired are the bulk of my force, I doubt if it would be wise to
         reckon on this."</p>
      
      
      <p>At 11.15, red hot from France, there arrived in camp <span class="person">Byng</span> (to command
         the <span class="unit">9th Corps</span>), <span class="person">Maude</span> and <span class="person">Fanshawe</span> (to command Divisions); also Tyrrell
         and <span class="person">Byng</span>'s A.D.C., Sir B. Brooke, nephew of my old friend, Harry Brooke.
         All three Generals remained for lunch and then the two Divisionals made
         off respectively to the 11th and <span class="unit">13th Division</span>s. <span class="person">Byng</span> and Brooke stayed
         and dined. These fellows seem pretty cheery. <span class="person">Maude</span> especially full of
         ardour which will, I hope, catch on.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 24th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span> Been resolving yesterday's long cable. How
         often it happens that a draft letter, if only it is well put, fixes the
         mind into its grooves. My words were brighter than <span class="person">Dawnay</span>'s but the
         backbone was not really me. No one knows better than myself that a great
         deal more than arithmetic or measurement will be needed to make me give
         ground at <span class="location">Suvla</span>. The truth is, it is infinitely difficult to spur these
         high folk on without frightening them; and then, if you frighten them,
         you may frighten them too much. That's why cables are no substitutes for
         converse.</p>
      
      
      <p>To a Commander standing in my shoes, the forces of the infidels are not
         one half of the battle. The wobblers sit like nightmares on my chest.
         "Tell them the plain truth" cries conscience. What is the plain truth?
         Where is it? Is it in <span class="person">Dawnay</span>'s draft, or is it in my message, or does it
         lie stillborn in some cable unwritten? God knows--I don't! But one thing
         at least is true:--to steer a course between an optimism that deprives
         us of support and a pessimism that may wreck the whole enterprise, there
         indeed is a Scylla and Charybdis problem, a two-horned dilemma, or
         whatever words may best convey the notion of the devil.</p>
      
      
      <p>The blessed cable is now lying on the well-known desk where <span class="person">K.</span> will
         frown at it through his enormous spectacles. Then he calls the
         Adjutant-General and tells him Hamilton must be mad as all his
         formations are full to overflowing and yet he says he is 45,000 short.
         Next enters the Master-General of the Ordnance with a polite bow and <span class="person">K.</span>
         tells him Hamilton must be delirious as he keeps on raving for shell,
         bombs, grenades although as he, Von Donop, knows well, he has been sent
         more guns and explosives than any man has ever enjoyed in war.
         Impossible to be so disrespectful to the Field Marshal or so
         inconsiderate to their department as to reject the soft impeachment. How
         easily do the great ones of this world kid themselves back into a
         comfortable frame of mind! Then <span class="person">K.</span> stalks off to the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>
         Committee.</p>
      
      
      <p>Turns out that <span class="person">Cox</span> and Russell did even better than <span class="person">Birdwood</span> had thought
         in the fighting on the 21st and the morning of the 22nd. They have
         killed more Turks and the line held runs well out to the North-east and
         quite a good long way to the North of <span class="location">Kaiajik Aghala</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Byng left to take over his command. <span class="person">Davies</span> came over from <span class="location">Helles</span> and
         stayed for dinner.</p>
      
      
      <p>The  Imogene  sailed in with Mails. News by wireless of German Naval
         defeat in the Baltic and Italian declaration of war against Turkey.
         Well, that part at least of <span class="person">K.</span>'s aspirations has come off; we have
         dragged in Italy. Now--will she send us a contingent?</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Davies</span> dined. With his ideas still framed on Western standards he puts
         it forcibly, not to say ferociously, that we must, must,  must  be given
         our fair share of trench mortars, bombs and gun ammunition. Fresh from
         France he watched the artillery preparation at <span class="location">Helles</span> and (although we
         had thought it rather grand) says we simply don't know what the word
         bombardment means. Instead of seeing, as in the Western theatre, an
         unbroken wall of flame and smoke rising above the enemy trenches about
         to be stormed, here he saw a sprinkling of shells bursting at intervals
         of 20 yards or so--a totally different effect. And yet the Turks are as
         tough as the Germans and take as much hammering!</p>
      
      
      <p>When I read the British Press, starved and yet muzzled, I feel as if I
         could render my country no better service than to kill my friend the
         Censor and write them one or two articles.</p>
      
      
      <p>By surprise either Army can bulge in a sector of the opposing lines but,
         until one Army loses its  moral , neither Army can break through. An
         engine will be found to restore marches and manoeuvres but, at this
         historic moment, our tactics are at that stage. To break through, Armies
         must advance some six or seven miles; otherwise they can't bag the
         enemy's big guns. But, the backbone of their attack, their own guns,
         can't support them when they get beyond five or six miles. The enemy
         reserves come in; they come at last to a stop. A three or four mile
         advance  should  be easy enough, but, in the West, that would mean just
         three or four miles of land; nothing more. But  here , those three or
         four miles--nay, two or three miles--(so ineffective in France) are an
         objective in themselves; they give us the strategical hub of the
         universe--Constantinople!</p>
      
      
      <p>Suppose even that by paying the cost in lives we did succeed in driving
         the Germans over the Rhine, still we stand to gain less than by taking
         this one little peninsula! A quarter of the energy they are about to
         develop for the sake of getting back a few miles of  la belle France 
         could give us Asia; Africa; the Balkans; the Black Sea; the mouths of
         the Danube: it would enable us to swap rifles for wheat with the
         Russians; more vital still, it would tune up the hearts of the Russian
         soldiery to the Anglo-Saxon pitch.</p>
      
      
      <p>Victory by killing Germans is a barbarous notion and a savage method. A
         thrust with small forces at a weak spot to bring the enemy to their
         knees by loss of provinces, resources and prestige is an artistic idea
         and a scientific stroke: the one stands for a cudgel blow, the other for
         rapier play.</p>
      
      
      <p>We take it for granted that we have to "push" in France and <span class="location">Flanders</span>;
         that we  have  to exhaust ourselves in forcing the invaders back over
         their own frontiers. Whereas, content to "hold" there, we might push
         wherever else we wished.</p>
      
      
      <p>I can well understand that a Frenchman should say, "Let the world go
         hang provided I get back my  Patrie , whole; undivided and at once."
         Indeed, only the other day, one of the best French Generals here, after
         speaking of the decisive, world-embracing consequences of a victory at
         the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>, went on to say, "But we ought to be in France." Seeing
         my surprise he added, "Yes, I am quite illogical, I admit, but until our
         nine  departements  are freed from the Boche, world strategy and tactics
         may go to the devil for me."</p>
      
      
      <p>
         Have been writing my weekly budget. Part of my letter to <span class="person">K.</span> harks back
         to the first <span class="location">Suvla</span> landing, and tries to give him a better notion of the
         failure to profit by the enemy's surprise. Not that I have yet got any
         very clear conception of the detail myself. No coherent narrative does,
         in fact, exist. New troops, new Staff, new Generals, heavy losses, have
         resulted in the confusions, gaps and contradictions still obscuring the
         story of those first few days.</p>
      
      
      <p>Now that I am getting more precise news about what fighting there was,
         it seems clear that this great mass of young, inexperienced troops
         failed simply because their leaders failed to grasp the urgency of the
         time problem when they got upon the ground, although, as far as orders
         and pen and ink could go, it had been made perfectly clear. But, in face
         of the Turk, things wore another and more formidable shape. Had Lord
         <span class="person">Bobs</span> been Commander of the <span class="unit">9th Corps</span>; yes, just think of it! How far my
         memory carries me back. Every item needed for the rapid advance: water,
         ammunition, supplies and mules closely and personally checked and
         counter-checked. Once the troops landed a close grip kept on the
         advance. At the first sign of a check nothing keeps him from the spot.
         The troops see him. In an hour they are up upon the crest.</p>
      
      
      <p>So far, so good. We had not another Lord <span class="person">Bobs</span> and it would not have been
         reasonable of us to expect him. But when I come to the failure of the
         21st, where I have a seasoning of Regulars--as well as a commander of
         energy--still we do not succeed. This time, no doubt, the enemy were on
         the scene in force and had done ten days' digging; the non-success, in
         fact, may be traced to the loss of the element of surprise; energy, in
         fact, was met by preparation. The battle had to be fought like a
         manoeuvre battle and yet the enemy were ready for us, more or less,
         and already fairly well entrenched. Since the morning of the 7th the
         chances had been rising steadily against us. Still, even so, the lack of
         precise detail baffles me almost as much as in the case of the first
         <span class="location">Suvla</span> landing.</p>

      <p>CHAPTER XVIII MISUNDERSTANDINGS</p>
      
      
      
      <p> 25th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros </span> <span class="person">Davies</span>left for <span class="location">Helles</span> at mid-day. Was to
         have gone with <span class="person">him</span> but heard that <span class="person">Bailloud</span> with <span class="person">Captain Lapruin</span> would
         like to see me, so stayed to receive them.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have got <span class="person">K.'s</span> answer to my cable pointing out the probable results of
         <span class="person">his</span> declared intention of sending us no "reinforcements of importance"
         during an indeterminate period.</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. 7315, cipher). From <span class="person">Earl Kitchener</span> to <span class="person">General Sir Ian Hamilton.
            </span><span class="person">Your</span> No. 578. You will, <span class="person">I</span> hope, fully discuss the situation described by
         you with <span class="person">Birdwood</span> and the Generals who have just joined you, and, when a
         thorough examination on the ground of the whole state of affairs has
         been made, give <span class="person">me</span> the opinion at which you arrive.</p>
      
      
      <p>"It has been a sad disappointment to <span class="person">me</span> that the troops have not been
         able to do better, and that the drafts and reinforcements sent out to
         <span class="person">you</span> and <span class="location">Egypt</span>, excluding any you have drawn from <span class="location">Egypt</span>, amounting from
         6th August to 47,000, have not proved sufficient to enable you to
         contemplate holding your positions."</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Braithwaite</span> and I have been electrified by this reference to 47,000
         drafts and reinforcements: it is so much Greek to us here: had there
         been any question of reinforcements coming to us on that scale, my 578
         of 23rd August would never have been sent.</p>
      
      
      <p>On the heels of this has followed another:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. 7319, cipher). From <span class="person">Earl Kitchener</span> to General <span class="person">Sir Ian Hamilton.</span> My
         No. 7315. <span class="person">I</span> hope that the result of <span class="person">your</span> deliberations will reach <span class="person">me</span> by
         Friday morning, as the decision to be taken is one of considerable
         importance."</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">I</span> have replied off the reel:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F. 588). From <span class="person">General Sir Ian Hamilton</span> to <span class="person">Earl Kitchener.</span> With
         reference to your telegrams Nos. 7315 and 7319. I feel sure you cannot
         think I would be capable of sending a telegram of such import as my No.
         M.F. 578 without the deepest consideration and sense of my personal
         responsibility which remains unaffected by any amount of conferences
         with my subordinate commanders. I was careful in this instance, however,
         to discuss the situation on the spot with both Corps Commanders
         concerned and I then cabled <span class="person">you</span> my considered opinion. I constantly
         visit both <span class="location">Suvla</span> and <span class="location">Anzac</span> and have personally thoroughly examined the
         state of affairs. In view of your telegram No. 7172, cipher, I do not
         understand <span class="person">your</span> allusion to 47,000 drafts and reinforcements from 6th
         August as we have not been advised of any such number as 47,000. I felt
         bound to lay the case plainly before <span class="person">you</span> as to what might have to be
         undertaken, though I do not contemplate giving up any position one hour
         before I need. If the present wastage from sickness continues, however,
         and if my cadres are allowed to fall below their present attenuated
         strength I may be compelled to undertake such a step as I have
         indicated."</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Bailloud</span> arrived at tea time. Away from <span class="location">Piépape</span> <span class="person">he</span> is another person. At
         dinner, <span class="person">he</span> cracked jokes even about serious things like the guns of
         Asia.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Brodrick</span> was carried off to the Hospital ship. The doctors think there
         should be no real danger. We shall all miss <span class="person">him</span> very much; as an aide <span class="person">he</span>
         has been A.1.; sympathetic and thoughtful.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Braithwaite</span> dined to meet <span class="person">Bailloud.</span></p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 26th August, 1915.  After clearing my table and taking early lunch,
         started off in the <span class="location"> Arno </span> with C.G.S., <span class="person">Pollen</span>, <span class="person">Freddie</span> and <span class="person">Val.</span> Sailed
         for <span class="location">Suvla</span> and went up straight to see <span class="person">Byng</span>, brought by the whirl of
         Fortune's wheel from a French chateau to a dugout. During the two days
         <span class="person">he</span> has been here, <span class="person">he</span> has been working very hard. I hope <span class="person">he</span> may not too
         regretfully look back towards  la belle <span class="location">France</span> . Our old "A" Beach was
         being briskly shelled as we walked down to our boats. Between <span class="location">Hill 10</span>
         and the sea there were salvoes of shrapnel falling and about every
         thirty seconds a big fellow, probably a six incher, made a terrible
         hullaballoo. The men working at piling up stores "carried on."</p>
      
      
      <p>[Illustration: GENERAL BAILLOUD  "Exclusive News" phot. ]</p>
      
      
      <p>When we got back to G.H.Q. there was a heavy thunderstorm in progress.
         Mail bag closed 9.30.</p>
      
      
      <p>During our inspection at <span class="location">Suvla</span> this "Personal" from <span class="person">K.</span> to myself has
         been deciphered:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"(No. 7337, cipher). From <span class="person">Earl Kitchener</span> to General <span class="person">Sir Ian Hamilton.</span>
         Personal. <span class="person">I</span> considered it advisable, that as the decision the Government
         may have to come to on <span class="person">your</span> No. 578 is one of grave importance, the
         Generals out there should previously fully consider the situation on the
         <span class="location">Gallipoli</span>"&gt;; hence <span class="person">my</span> No. 7315. It was intended to obviate any
         possibility of overlooking points and in such cases two or more heads
         sometimes elucidate matters that might otherwise be missed or not given
         due weight to. It was in no way intended thereby to detract from the
         importance of <span class="person">your</span> views on the subject or to minimise <span class="person">your</span> personal
         responsibility for them.</p>
      
      
      <p>"<span class="person">I</span> have no idea of the French Generals' views on the matter, and <span class="person">you</span>
         were apparently not fully considering the drafts and reinforcements that
         were being sent out.</p>
      
      
      <p>"A detailed telegram is being sent <span class="person">you</span> from the office of the 47,000 men
         mentioned in <span class="person">my</span> No. 7315.</p>
      
      
      <p>"<span class="person">I</span> hope that the return of <span class="unit">Younghusband's Brigade</span> from <span class="location">Aden</span> to <span class="location">Egypt</span>
         will still further increase these in a day or two (less one battalion).</p>
      
      
      <p>"But <span class="person">you</span> should look on the forces in <span class="location">Egypt</span> and <span class="person">your</span> own as a whole,
         allowing, of course, for the proper defence of <span class="location">Egypt</span>, when you take the
         general situation at the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> into consideration.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Do <span class="person">you</span> think the Navy could do anything more than they are already
         doing to help the situation? <span class="person">I</span> hear it is thought that they could land
         heavy naval 6-inch guns on positions such as those in square 92 M and
         other points, and might threaten from <span class="location">Aja Liman</span> the main road of <span class="location">Turkish</span>
         supplies between <span class="location">Karna Bili</span> and <span class="location">Solvili</span>(by gunfire from ships) and also
         bring a heavy and effective shell fire on the <span class="location">Turkish</span> positions at and
         behind <span class="location">Anafarta</span>. There is a cabinet to-morrow."</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">I</span> would much like to sleep over this cable--so plain seemingly; really
         so obscure. At face value, how splendidly it simplifies the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>
         problem! Had <span class="person">I</span> been, all along, as this cable seems to make <span class="person">me</span>, the
         C.-in-C. of the Eastern Mediterranean with <span class="person">Maxwell</span> administering <span class="person">my</span>
         <span class="location">Egypt</span>ian Base, then, humanly speaking, this entry would have been dated
         from <span class="location">Constantinople.</span> But am <span class="person">I?</span> <span class="person">I</span> can't believe it even now, with the
         words before <span class="person">me</span>. Anyway, whether by <span class="person">my</span> own fault or those of others, one
         thing is certain, namely, that up to date there has been
         misunderstanding. Now, the Cabinet of to-morrow forces <span class="person">me</span> to send a
         momentous wire without too much time to think it over. To clear <span class="person">my</span> brain
         let <span class="person">me</span> set down the sequence of facts as they have so far appeared to
         <span class="person">me</span>:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>Less than a week ago--20th inst.<span class="person">--K.</span> cables me <span class="person">he</span> is sending certain
         units to <span class="location">Egypt</span> and certain other units to the <span class="location">Dardanelles.</span> The units and
         their ships are named. <span class="person">He</span> says there is going to be a big push in
         <span class="location">France</span> and that I must look to these troops, earmarked for the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles,</span> plus any I "can obtain from <span class="location">Egypt</span>" to carry on. <span class="person">He</span> winds up
         by saying, "It is hoped the troops going to <span class="location">Egypt</span> will enable <span class="person">Maxwell</span> to
         send <span class="person">you</span> more fighting men on <span class="person">your</span> demand."</p>
      
      
      <p>This same assumption that the G.O.C., <span class="location">Egypt</span>, and <span class="person">myself</span> are two equals
         each having equal command over his own troops, is fully borne out by
         another cable of the 21st August. My cable of 23rd August is based on
         these messages; i.e. on the idea that we must carry on here for a good
         long time to come with very little to help us. Then comes <span class="person">K.'s</span> of the
         25th telling me <span class="person">he</span> is sorry 47,000 drafts and reinforcements <span class="person">he</span> has sent
         to <span class="person">Maxwell</span> and <span class="person">myself</span> since 6th August are not going to be enough to
         enable me to hold on. But no one can make head or tail of these 47,000
         drafts and reinforcements; no one can run them to ground. <span class="person">He</span> has
         notified me the units and the ships, but the total coming to <span class="person">Maxwell</span>
         and  <span class="person">myself</span> don't tot up to that figure, much less the portion of them
         detailed for the <span class="location">Dardanelles.</span>[11] Now comes to-day's cable in which
         <span class="location">Egypt</span> is spoken of as being mine, and the fatness thereof. Taking this
         message  per se , any one might imagine I could draw any troops I liked
         from that country provided that  I  thought  I  was leaving enough to
         defend the Suez Canal: and, apparently, the 47,000 men are about to
         make an effort to materialize inasmuch as we are told that details are
         being wired us. Finally, <span class="unit">Younghusband's Brigade</span> sails to help us!</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 27th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros. </span> As there is a Cabinet to-day I had to get
         off my answer last night. In it I have made a desperate effort to
         straighten out the tangle:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F. 589). From <span class="person">General Sir Ian Hamilton</span> to <span class="person">Earl Kitchener.</span> On
         returning from <span class="location">Suvla</span> I have just found <span class="person">your</span> No. 7337, cipher. I hope
         there may be no misunderstanding as to meaning or intention of my No.
         M.F. 578. I asked in my No. M.F. 562 for such drafts and reinforcements
         as I considered necessary for the campaign to be brought to a conclusion
         before the winter began. <span class="person">You</span> told me in <span class="person">your</span> No. 7172 that you could
         spare no more reinforcements beyond those mentioned therein, and that if
         I could not achieve success with these I must remain on the defensive
         for some considerable time. I explained situation in my No. M.F. 578,
         and said that the question was one of arithmetic and measurement. I was
         anxious to hold all I had got and to gain more, but I required all my
         available force at the present time merely to hold what I had got. I
         pointed out that meanwhile a large proportion of my troops were urgently
         in need of rest, and sickness was so great that unless reinforcements
         were sent out my force would soon be too small for the number of yards
         of front to be held. In that case, i.e., if reinforcements could not be
         spared, but in that case only, it would be necessary to contract my
         line. This welcome news of 47,000 reinforcements, however, alters the
         whole situation. Such a number will do much to complete my diminished
         cadres, and should materially lessen sick rate by giving more chance of
         taking tired troops out of the trenches. <span class="person">Byng</span> can certainly remain where
         <span class="person">he</span> is at present, and will even be able to rest some of the tired <span class="unit">XXIXth Division</span>, while the arrival of the <span class="location">Australia</span> Brigade will give <span class="person">General
            Birdwood</span> a similar chance of resting some of <span class="person">his</span> troops.</p>
      
      
      <p>"<span class="person">General Birdwood</span> meanwhile is to make a further advance to-morrow on
         the left flank, to gain possession of important tactical feature, which
         will eventually help an advance when the time arrives. <span class="person">Byng</span> is getting
         everything in order and has infected all around <span class="person">him</span> with <span class="person">his</span> own energy
         and cheeriness and has quickly grasped the whole situation.</p>
      
      
      <p>"In communication with <span class="person">Maxwell</span> I find I can have seven Territorial Force
         units and the Scottish Horse, and now I have your welcome news of
         <span class="unit">Younghusband's Brigade.</span> Please believe I am the last man in the world to
         give up anything we have gained except under direct necessity, which I
         trust may now never arise. The Navy is supporting me to its full
         capacity. The guns of the four ships in <span class="location">Suvla Bay</span> take on the <span class="location">Turkish</span>
         positions you mention almost as well as and certainly more safely than
         if they were landed and placed where you suggest. Moreover, Navy cannot
         lend those guns unless I supply the detachments to work them from the
         Naval Division, and the latter is fully employed at present and cannot
         spare the men. We are constantly sending ships round to <span class="location">Aja Liman</span> to
         fire at enemy positions from there, but I know you realize that one must
         not rely too much upon effective fire on land targets from ships which
         are not moored, as is the case in <span class="location">Suvla Bay.</span></p>
      
      
      <p>"I have not consulted the French General about the situation in the
         North as he is at the Southern end and on the right of the line there.
         He thinks more of Asia than of these operations in which he has no
         troops engaged, but I discussed the matter with him only last night.
         Before I sent my No. M.F. 578 I discussed every point closely for two
         hours with the Corps Commanders."</p>
      
      
      <p>In the evening my A.G. brought me the promised details of the 47,000
         drafts and reinforcements. He has gone into the detail in proper A.G.
         spirit, namely, as an arithmetician rather than a tactician. The result
         has given us a shock! 10,000 men of the <span class="unit">54th Division</span> and 4,000 drafts
         are shown in the War Office cable as being still due to come to me as
         reinforcements whereas they had actually landed on the <span class="location">Gallipoli</span>"; had,
         indeed, been shown in my total fighting strength of 68,000 in my
         original cable, M.F. 578 of 23rd August, and are, too many of them, alas
         already  hors de combat . Here is the passage sent four days ago:--"The
         total casualties including sick since 6th August amount to 40,000, and
         my total force is now only 85,000 of which the fighting strength is
         68,000." In this 68,000 were included 14,000 of the men shown in
         subsequent  War Office cables as being drafts and reinforcements on
         their way to the <span class="location">Dardanelles!</span></p>
      
      
      <p>So my A.G. has become a bit suspicious about the balance of the 47,000.
         On paper, he says, it looks as if I might expect to draw from <span class="location">Egypt</span> and
         <span class="location">England</span> 30,000 reinforcements, but--he remarks sententiously--"we know
         by now that paper is one thing and men are different." As to
         <span class="unit">Younghusband's Brigade</span>, it turns out they cannot be employed here: too
         many Mahomedans. Have sent the following reply:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F. 595). From <span class="person">General Sir Ian Hamilton</span> to Secretary of State for
         War. With reference to your telegram No. 7337, cipher. Have now received
         details of the 47,000 drafts and reinforcements in your No. 7354 cipher,
         and I find that this figure includes nearly 10,000 men of the LIVth
         Division and 4,234 drafts, all of whom had been landed on the peninsula
         when I wrote my No. M.F. 578, and were reckoned in the total fighting
         strength of 68,000 mentioned in that telegram. The statement, however,
         shows that I can expect from <span class="location">England</span> and <span class="location">Egypt</span> during the next six weeks
         a total of some 29,000 reinforcements, including new formations and two
         battalions of non-fighting lines of communication troops.</p>
      
      
      <p>"This is a better situation than I was led by your 7172, cipher, to
         expect, and you may rely on me to do the best I can with this addition
         to my present very depleted strength. I hope, however, you realize that
         whereas my <span class="location">British</span> Divisions are now more than 55,000 rifles below their
         establishment only 17,000 of these 29,000 are drafts, and before the
         last of the drafts can arrive these divisions will have lost another 25
         per cent. of their remaining number by normal wastage.</p>
      
      
      <p>"In regard to <span class="unit">Younghusband's Brigade</span>, I learn that the three battalions
         are practically half Mahomedans, and I am advised that it is better if
         it can be avoided not to use Mahomedans so near the heart of Islam.
         Would it not be possible to exchange these for some Hindu regiments in
         <span class="location">France</span>?"</p>
      
      
      <p>These cables give us an uncomfortable feeling that the people at home
         wish to regard us as stronger than we are--a different thing from
         wishing to add to our strength.</p>
      
      
      <p>On the other hand, another sort of message has come in which sheds a ray
         of hope across our path so darkened at many other points:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No 7372, cipher). From <span class="person">Earl Kitchener</span> to <span class="person">General Sir Ian Hamilton.</span>
         Although it is understood that we do not at present see our way to
         change the recent decision not to send any fresh complete divisional
         units, we wish to have all the material possible on which to form a
         judgment from time to time. Therefore, will <span class="person">you</span> please telegraph <span class="person">me</span> <span class="person">your</span>
         opinion, from the point of view of the military and strategical
         situation now existing on the peninsula, as to the prospects there are,
         after the experience <span class="person">you</span> have recently had, of our achieving the main
         objective of turning the Turks out and what force <span class="person">you</span> would consider
         would be required to do this."</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Taylor of the G.S.</span> lunched. A big parcel mail came in. <span class="person">Brodrick</span> is to be
         sent to <span class="location">Alexandria.</span></p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p> 28th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros. </span> <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> and I both feel we must take
         time to think over last night's last cable and I have wired to say so.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Cox's</span> attack on Knoll 60 to the North-east of <span class="location">Kaiajik Aghala</span> came off
         well. The <span class="location">New Zealanders</span> under <span class="person">Russell</span> and the Connaught Rangers did
         brilliantly. Fighting is still going on.</p>
      
      
      <p>A reply from the War Office to mine of last week wherein I pointed out
         that the once splendid <span class="unit">5th Battalion Royal Scots</span> had fallen from a
         strength of 1,000 down to 289. They have had no one since the campaign
         began. To-day the Battalion is just over 250--a Company! Now I am
         officially told that "no reinforcements can be found for the 1/5th
         Battalion of Royal Scots." This is the Battalion which did so well about
         11 o'clock on the dreadful night of the 2nd May. I shall cable the <span class="person">Lord
            Provost of Edinburgh.</span> If we could get into touch with the human beings
         of Edinburgh they would help us to keep a battalion like the <span class="unit">Royal Scots</span>
         on their legs even if they had to break up half a dozen new formations
         for the purpose.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Freddie</span> and I dined with <span class="person">de Robeck</span> on board <span class="location"> H.M.S.  Triad .</span> The V.A. was
         well pleased with my cable of the 26th.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 29th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros. </span> Last night two cables:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"(No. 7414, cipher. C.I.G.S.). From War Office to General Headquarters,
         Mediterranean Expeditionary Force. Reference your No. M.F.Q.T. 2737.
         The two Territorial Force battalions originally detailed-- see  my No.
         7172 of 20th August--to sail in the <span class="location"> Orsova </span> will be taken by the
         <span class="location"> Ceramic .</span> Of these, the 2/5th Devons is only about 700 strong and
         contains a large percentage of recruits, while the 1/6th Royal Scots
         contains about 40 per cent. partially trained men and a new Commanding
         Officer who has only just been appointed. Until it has had further
         training neither battalion is fit for anything more than garrison duty.
         I suggest that under these circumstances the <span class="location"> Ceramic </span> should proceed
         direct to <span class="location">Egypt</span>."</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. 7401, cipher, 554/A.3.). From War Office to Inspector-General of
         Communications, Mediterranean Expeditionary Force. We are receiving from
         <span class="location">Malta</span> and <span class="location">Alexandria</span> very large demands for materials and explosives for
         making grenades. The supply of these seriously interferes with our
         manufacture of grenades. At present we are hoping to send you 30 to
         40,000 grenades weekly and this figure will be increased. When the
         materials already sent out to <span class="location">Malta</span> and <span class="location">Alexandria</span> have been used up,
         can the manufacture of grenades at those places cease? Please repl/y at
         once; the matter is urgent."</p>
      
      
      <p>Do what I will my pen carries me away and I find myself writing like an
         ill-conditioned "grouser." As an old War Office "hand" I ought to
         know--and I do know--the frightful time of stress under which Whitehall
         labours. But, just look at these two cables, you innocent and peaceful
         citizen of a thousand years hence! The residue of the famous 47,000
         rifles sent me by the Adjutant-General are now being valued by the
         official valuer, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. In all our
         calculations the 2/5th Devons has hitherto masqueraded as an efficient
         battalion at full strength. Figures are sometimes more eloquent than
         words!</p>
      
      
      <p>As to the second cable, that deals us a worse blow. Seeing clearly, at
         last, we should extract no hand grenades from the War Office, we turned
         to <span class="person">Maxwell</span> and <span class="person">Methuen,</span> who have interested themselves in our plight and
         have been making us so many that, with what we ourselves can add to
         their manufacture, we are at last beginning to make things hum in the
         <span class="location">Turkish</span> trenches. Then in comes this War Office cable to crush our
         nascent industry and give us in exchange some pious aspirations.</p>
      
      
      <p>There is no good making any trouble about the hand grenades. As to the
         two raw battalions, I am asking they be sent, raw and weak as they are,
         as I can train them in the trenches much better and more quickly than
         they could be trained in <span class="location">Egypt</span> or <span class="location">England</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Church Parade; office work; sailed over to "K" Beach; inspected Clearing
         Stations and walked up to site for new camp. Then back to G.H.Q., to
         meet the V.A. and <span class="person">Roger Keyes.</span> They remain the best of friends always.</p>
      
      
      <p>This evening we were all in good form owing to the news from <span class="location">Anzac.</span>
         Knoll 60, now ours throughout, commands the Biyuk Anafarta valley with
         view and fire--a big tactical scoop.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 30th August, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros. </span> Still good news from <span class="location">Anzac.</span> Seeing that the
         stunt was on a small scale, we seem to have got into the Turks with a
         vengeance. In falling back as well as in counter-attacking after we had
         taken <span class="location">Hill 60</span>, the enemy were exposed to the fire from our trenches
         along the Kaiajik Dere. Birdie declares that they have lost 5,000. We
         have taken several machine guns and trench mortars as well as some fifty
         prisoners. Have sent grateful message to all on the spot.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 10.30 four Russian Officers made their salaams. They are to report
         how things are going, and they seem to have the usual quick Slav faculty
         for grasping essential points combined, no doubt, with the usual Slav
         slackness which lets them go again. I told them everything I knew. They
         told us that our landing had saved the whole Army of the Caucasus; that
         the Grand Duke knew it and that His Imperial Highness bitterly regretted
         that, first of all, sheer lack of supplies; afterwards the struggles in
         Galicia and <span class="location">Poland</span>, had prevented <span class="person">Istomine</span> and his Army Corps from
         standing by to help.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 1.30 the C.G.S., <span class="person">Deedes</span>, <span class="person">Val.,</span> <span class="person">Freddy</span> and I crossed to <span class="location">Helles</span> in the
         <span class="location"> Arno .</span> Had a hard afternoon's walking, going first to 8th Corps
         Headquarters; next to the <span class="unit">Royal Naval Division</span> and last to the 52nd
         Divisional Headquarters. Returned to the 8th Corps Headquarters and
         there met <span class="person">Bailloud.</span> <span class="person">He</span> is now full of good cheer. Got back to
         Headquarters without adventure or misadventure.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have cabled home a suggestion made to me by <span class="person">Mahon</span>, that the <span class="unit">16th Irish
            Division</span> at home might be used to fill up the gaps in the units of the
         <span class="unit">10th Division</span> out here.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 31st August, 1915.  After early lunch, left in the <span class="location"> Arno </span> for <span class="location">Suvla.</span> With
         me were <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>, <span class="person">Manifold</span>, <span class="person">Freddy</span> and <span class="person">Val.</span> Walked up to the 9th
         Corps Headquarters and saw <span class="person">Byng.</span> I am very anxious indeed <span class="person">he</span> should work
         <span class="person">his</span> men up into the mood for making a push. <span class="person">He</span> charms everyone and <span class="person">he</span> is
         fast pulling <span class="person">his</span> force together. <span class="person">Maude,</span> <span class="person">Fanshawe,</span> and <span class="person">de Lisle</span> seem to
         be keen to do something, but <span class="person">Byng,</span> though <span class="person">he</span> also is keen, has the
         French standards for ammunition in <span class="person">his</span> head. <span class="person">He</span> does not think we have
         enough to warrant us in making an attack. Also, <span class="person">he</span> does not realize yet
         that if <span class="person">he</span> is going to wait until we are fitted out on that scale <span class="person">he</span>
         will have to wait till doomsday.</p>
      
      
      <p>Walked to <span class="person">de Lisle's</span> Headquarters and saw <span class="person">him</span>, and on to the 11th
         Divisional Headquarters where I met <span class="person">Fanshawe</span> and <span class="person">Malcolm.</span> With them I
         climbed back on to <span class="location">Karakol Dagh</span> and sat me down on the identical same
         stone whereon I sweated blood during that confused and indecisive battle
         of the 21st August. From the <span class="location">Karakol Dagh</span> I got a very fair idea of our
         whole trench system. On either flank we hold the hills; elsewhere we are
         on the flat. <span class="unit">The 11th Division</span> have recovered and only need drafts to be
         as good a formation as any General could wish to command. In the evening
         I left in the <span class="location"> Arno </span> carrying off with me <span class="person">de Lisle</span> and <span class="person">Captain Hardress
            Lloyd</span> to dine and stay the night. <span class="person">Quentin Agnew</span> also dined.</p>
      
      
      <p>My first feeble little attempt to act on <span class="person">K.'s</span> assumption that <span class="location">Egypt</span> and
         its army are mine has fallen a bit flat. The War Office promptly agreed
         to my taking these two weak, half-trained battalions, the and <span class="unit">2/5th Devons,</span> to be trained in my trenches. That was
         yesterday. But the Senoussi must have heard of it at once, for <span class="person">Maxwell</span>
         forthwith cables, "The attitude of the Senoussi is distinctly dangerous
         and his people have been latterly executing night manoeuvres round our
         post at <span class="location">Sollum.</span>" To <span class="person">me,</span> the night manoeuvres of these riff-raff seem
         ridiculous. But distance, perhaps, has lent its enchantment to my view.</p>
      
      
      <p>The quibble that the troops in <span class="location">Egypt</span> are mine has been broken to pieces
         by my first touch! I have renounced the two battalions with apologies
         and now I daresay the Senoussi will retire from his night manoeuvres
         round <span class="location">Sollum</span> and resume his old strategic position up <span class="person">Maxwell's</span> sleeve.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 1st September, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros.  </span>Remained at Headquarters working. Wrote,
         amongst other things, to <span class="person">K.</span> as follows:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"I have just finished two days' hard physical exercise going round
         visiting <span class="location">Egerton</span> and <span class="location">Paris</span> with <span class="person">Davies,</span> and <span class="person">Fanshawe</span> and <span class="person">de Lisle</span> with
         <span class="person">Byng.</span> At <span class="location">Helles</span> everything is quite right although they have only troops
         enough there for the defensive. They are getting a lot of stores in,
         and the really only anxious feature of the situation is the health of
         the men who are very, very tired right through, having had no sort of
         relief for months, and who go sick in large numbers.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"<span class="person">Fanshawe</span> is first class. Full of go and plans, <span class="person">he</span> will, if the Lord
         spares him, be a real treasure. <span class="person">Maude</span> and <span class="person">Mahon</span> I am going to see after
         Mail-day, and then I shall hope to inspect our new captured position on
         the left of <span class="location">Anzac.</span></p>
      
      
      <p>"I do not know if they showed you the cable saying <span class="person">Hammersley</span> has gone
         home very ill with a clot of blood in his leg. <span class="person">He</span> has to lie perfectly
         prostrate and still, so I am told, as the least movement might set it
         loose and it would then kill <span class="person">him.</span> Evidently <span class="person">he</span> was not really fit to
         have been sent out on service. And this was the man, remember, on whom,
         under <span class="person">Stopford,</span> everything depended for making a push.</p>
      
      
      <p>"This <span class="location">Suvla Bay</span> country, a jungle ringed round by high mountains, is
         essentially a country for Boers or for <span class="location">Indian</span> troops. <span class="person">De Lisle</span> and
         others who have watched them closely in India, say that a native soldier
         on the <span class="location">Gallipoli</span> (although there, too, he goes to pieces if he loses his
         Officers and under too prolonged a strain) is worth at least two <span class="location">Indian</span>
         soldiers in <span class="location">France</span>. The climate suits him better, but, most of all, the
         type of enemy is more or less the sort of type they are accustomed to
         encounter. Not  Sahibs  and  Ghora Log  in helmets but  Mussalman Log 
         in turbans. As to the South Africans, there can be no two opinions, I
         think, that they would stand these conditions better than those of
         Northern Europe. Indeed, we have one or two Boers serving now with the
         <span class="location">Australians,</span> and they have done extremely well."</p>
      
      
      <p>Some of <span class="person">K.'s</span> questions take my breath away. I wish very much indeed <span class="person">he</span>
         could come and spend a week with <span class="person">me.</span> Otherwise I feel hopeless of making
         <span class="person">him</span> grasp the realities of the trenches. On the 30th of August <span class="person">he</span>
         cables, "If required, I could send you a fresh consignment of junior
         Officers. Or have you sufficient supernumerary Officers to fill all
         casualties?" I have replied to <span class="person">him</span> that, in my four regular Divisions, I
         am short of 900 effective Officers in the Infantry alone. To meet my
         total shortage of 1,450 Officers I have twenty-five young gentlemen who
         have lately been sent out here to complete their training!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">De Lisle</span> and <span class="person">Hardress Lloyd</span> sailed back to <span class="location">Suvla</span> in the evening.</p>

      <p>CHAPTER XIX THE FRENCH PLAN
         </p>
      
      
      <p> 2nd September, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  An ugly dream came to me last night. My
         tent was at <span class="location">Imbros</span> right enough, and I was lying in my little camp bed,
         and yet I was being drowned, held violently under the <span class="location">Helles</span>pont.</p>
      
      
      <p>The grip of a hand was still on my throat; the waters were closing over
         my head as I broke away and found myself wide awake. I was trembling and
         carried back with me into the realms of consciousness an idea that some
         uncanny visitor had entered my tent. Already the vision was fading. I
         could visualize the form of the presence, but the face remained hidden
         in shadow. Never had I suffered from so fearful a dream. For hours
         afterwards I was haunted by the thought that the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> were fatal;
         that something sinister was a-foot; that we, all of us, were pre-doomed.</p>
      
      
      <p>Dreams go by contraries. Strange that so black a night should be
         followed by a noon so brilliant--so brilliant beyond compare.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Lord K.</span> cables the French are going to send three or four Divisions to work
         with us along the Asiatic mainland. From bankrupt to millionaire in 24
         hours. The enormous spin of fortune's wheel makes me giddy!</p>
      
      
      <p>These French Divisions will be real Divisions:  must  be; they have no
         others.</p>
      
      
      <p>O, Hallelujah!</p>
      
      
      <p>"The sending of a force of three or four Divisions to operate on the
         Asiatic mainland, independent as regards command, but in close relation
         with the <span class="location">British</span> forces on the <span class="location">Peninsula</span>, is being considered by the
         French Government. They will require an exclusively French military base
         at <span class="location">Mitylene</span>, and us to help with transport and fleet.</p>
      
      
      <p>"So far I have not discussed any details with the French, and have
         simply told them we shall be delighted to have the help, which would be
         given by such an expedition, towards the solution of the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>
         problem.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Presumably they would require their two divisions now at Cape <span class="location">Helles</span>.
         What forces would you require to relieve them? I have asked Sir John
         French if the <span class="unit">XXVIIth</span> and <span class="unit">XXVIIIth</span> Divisions could be spared for this
         purpose.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Wire me any points that you think I had better settle with the French
         authorities."</p>
      
      
      <p> Deo volente  we are saved; <span class="location">Constantinople</span> is doomed. How clearly stand
         forth the mosques and minarets of the Golden Horn.</p>
      
      
      <p>Mr.<span class="person">Murdoch</span>, an <span class="location">Australia</span> journalist, paid me a visit to thank me for
         having stretched a point in <span class="person">his</span> favour by letting <span class="person">him</span> see the
         <span class="location">Peninsula.</span> Seemed a sensible man.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Glyn</span> and <span class="person">Holdich</span> dined: both clever fellows in different ways. <span class="person">Dawnay</span>
         and <span class="person">Glyn</span> after dinner left for <span class="location">England</span>. <span class="person">Dawnay</span> goes to explain matters
         first hand to <span class="person">Lord K.</span> Next to my going home myself, or to <span class="person">Lord K.</span> himself coming
         out here, this is the best I can do. <span class="person">Dawnay</span> is one of the soundest young
         officers we have, but <span class="person">he</span> is run down physically (like most of us) and
         jaded. <span class="person">He</span> should benefit by the trip and so should the rumour-mongers at
         home.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 3rd September, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  Two cables: one to say that the news
         about the French Divisions must be kept dark; the other, in reply to a
         question by me, refusing to let me consult <span class="person">de Robeck</span> on the matter. So
         <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> and I had to make out our cable expressing our delight and
         thankfulness, and advising how the troops might best be used entirely on
         our own.</p>
      
      
      <p>The cable took some doing but got it off my chest by mid-day and then
         sailed with <span class="person">Ellison</span>, <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> and <span class="person">Val</span> by the <span class="location"> Arno </span> to <span class="location">Suvla</span>. We
         landed this time on Lala Baba instead of at our usual Ghazi Baba. Every
         five minutes the Turks plumped one six-incher on to the beach. But
         nobody now seems to mind. A lot of Generals present; <span class="person">Byng</span>, <span class="person">Mahon</span>,
         <span class="person">Marshall</span>, <span class="person">Maude</span> and <span class="person">Peyton</span>. <span class="person">Mahon</span> took me up to the top of Lala Baba and
         showed me the disposition of <span class="person">his</span> division. <span class="person">He</span> kindly asked us all to tea
         at <span class="person">his</span> Headquarters but as someone added that <span class="person">Ashmead-Bartlett</span> was
         going to take a cinema photo of the scene I thought I would not be thus
         immortalized. The Scottish Horse were bivouacking on the beach; they
         have just landed but already they have lost a member or two of their
         Mess from shell fire. No wonder they looked a little bewildered, but
         soon they will shake down. When we got back to the <span class="location"> Arno </span> we found she
         had been hit by shrapnel, but no damage.</p>
      
      
      <p>Things at <span class="location">Suvla</span> are pulling together. No one gave me more confidence
         than <span class="person">Maude</span>. <span class="person">His</span> mind travels beyond the needs of the moment. <span class="person">He</span> is
         firmly convinced that no very out-of-the-way effort by the Allies is
         needed to score a big point in the War Game and that our hold-up here is
         not a reality but only a hold-up or petrefaction of the brains of the
         French and of our <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> Committee. I longed to tell him <span class="person">he</span> was
         doing them both, especially the French, an injustice, and that four
         splendid divisions were as good as on their way, but I had to content
         myself with saying to <span class="person">him</span> and to all the Generals that I was overjoyed
         at a piece of news received yesterday.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 4th September, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  Life would be as ditchwater were it not
         stirred to its depths by <span class="person">Lord K.</span>'s secret cable. Sailed over with <span class="person">Freddie</span> at
         11.30 to "K" Beach and inspected the <span class="unit">88th Brigade.</span> Had given orders to
         the <span class="location"> Arno </span> to stand by and to take me over to <span class="location">Anzac</span> in the afternoon,
         but the weather was so bad that I could not get off to her in the motor
         boat.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 7.15 p.m. the V.A. sent his picket boat for me and <span class="person">Freddie</span> and I went
         on board the  <span class="location">Triad</span> . At 10 p.m. <span class="location">she</span> started for <span class="location">Mudros</span>.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 5th September, 1915. H.M.S. "<span class="location">Triad</span>." <span class="location">Mudros</span>.  Anchored at <span class="location">Mudros</span> at 6
         a.m. Breakfast over, was met by <span class="person">Altham</span>, <span class="person">Colonel McMunn</span> and <span class="person">Captain
            Stephens</span> who took me ashore. There I met <span class="person">Lindley</span>, now commanding the
         troops on the island; also General <span class="person">Legge</span> (commanding the 2nd <span class="location">Australia</span>
         Division); Lord <span class="person">Dudley</span> and Colonel Forster. <span class="person">Lindley</span> seems pleased at
         having been given this command; says <span class="person">he</span> feels like a man out hunting who
         has a bad fall but alights on <span class="person">his</span> feet, and <span class="person">Altham</span> tells me <span class="person">he</span> is doing
         the work very well. <span class="person">Dudley</span>, too, seemed full of business and contented
         with <span class="person">his</span> lot.</p>
      
      
      <p>The moment I got through the reception stunt I set myself to work like a
         nigger at the Red Cross stunt:--that's how people talk now-a-days. Saw
         the 15th Stationary Hospital; the 110th <span class="location">Indian</span> Field Ambulance; "C"
         Section of No. 24 <span class="location">British</span> <span class="location">Indian</span> Hospital; ate a hearty lunch; inspected
         1st <span class="location">Australia</span> Stationary Hospital. Walking round a Hospital and seeing
         whether things are clean and bright is a treat but trying to cheer
         people up and give a fillip to all good works--that implies an
         expenditure of something vital and leaves a man, after a few hours,
         feeling the worse for wear.</p>
      
      
      <p>By 4.45 the day's task was well over so refreshed myself by some right
         soldier business reviewing the 4th Gurkhas under <span class="person">Major Tillard</span>--a
         superb battalion--1,000 strong!!! Had forgotten what a full battalion
         looks like. At 5.45 wound up by inspecting a huge Convalescent Depot
         under Colonel Forde and got back to the  <span class="location">Triad</span>  just in time for dinner.
         Wemyss dined also.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 6th September, 1915. H.M.S. "<span class="location">Triad</span>." <span class="location">Mudros</span>.  After breakfast sailed
         over to <span class="location">Mudros</span> West; <span class="person">Lindley</span> met me, also a host of doctors. Walked to
         No. 3 <span class="location">Australia</span> Hospital with an old acquaintance whose Italian name
         slips my memory at the moment; then to No. 2 <span class="location">Australia</span> Stationary
         Hospital; then to Convalescent Depot of Lowland Division. At 12.30 ran
         down to my launch and was swiftly conveyed to lunch on board the
         Europa  with <span class="person">Admiral Wemyss</span>. Such a lunch as a lost voyager may dream
         of in the desert. Like roses blooming in a snowdrift, so puffs and pies
         and kickshaws of all rarest sorts appeared upon a dazzling white
         tablecloth, and then--disappeared. We too had to disappear and sail back
         to <span class="location">Mudros</span> West again. Horses were waiting and I rode to No. 18
         Stationary Hospital and made a thorough overhaul of it from end to end;
         then tea with the Officers of No. 1. In No. 3 <span class="location">Australia</span> General were
         eighty nurses; in No. 3 Canadian Stationary seven nurses; in No. 1
         Canadian Stationary twenty-four nurses. Since Lady Brassey descended in
         some miraculous manner upon <span class="location">Imbros</span>, they were the first white women I
         had seen for six months. Their pretty faces were a refreshing sight: a
         capable crowd too: all these Hospitals were in good order, but the sick
         and wounded in charge of the girls looked the happiest--and no wonder.
         The Canadian Medicos are fresh from <span class="location">France</span> and discoursed about
         moral . Never a day passed, so they said, in <span class="location">France</span>, but some patient
         would, with tears in his eyes, entreat to be sent home. Here at <span class="location">Mudros</span>
         there had never been one single instance. The patients, if they said
         anything at all, have showed impatience to get back to their comrades in
         the fighting line. We discussed this mystery at tea and no one could
         make head or tail of it. In <span class="location">France</span> the men got a change; are pulled out
         of the trenches; can go to cafes; meet young ladies; get drinks and
         generally have a good time. On the Peninsula they are never safe for one
         moment (whether they are supposed to be resting or are in the firing
         line) from having their heads knocked off by a shell.</p>
      
      
      <p>Returned to the  <span class="location">Triad</span>  in time for dinner.</p>
      
      
      <p>Admiral vexed as his motor boat has gone ashore. <span class="person">Bowlby</span> is with it
         trying to get it off.</p>
      
      
      <p>The French Admiral commanding the Mediterranean Fleet has just sailed
         in.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 7th September, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  At 9.30 left the  <span class="location">Triad</span>  to call on
         <span class="person"> Admiral de la Perriera</span> on board the  <span class="location">Gaulois</span> . Thence to <span class="location"> H.M.S. Racoon </span>
         (Lieutenant-Commander Hardy) and started back for <span class="location">Imbros</span>, where we
         arrived in time for tea.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 8th September, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  Trying to clear a table blocked with
         papers as a result of my two days' trip. Have written to <span class="person">Lord K.</span> as the Mail
         bag goes to-morrow. Have told him I have had a nice letter from <span class="person">Mahon</span>,
         thanking me for allowing <span class="person">him</span> to rejoin <span class="person">his</span> Division and saying <span class="person">he</span> hopes
         <span class="person">he</span> may stay with them till the end. Have given <span class="person">him</span> all my <span class="location">Mudros</span> news
         and have sent <span class="person">him</span> a memo. submitted to me by <span class="person">Birdwood</span> showing how much
         of the sickness on the <span class="location">Peninsula</span> seems due to the War Office having hung
         up my first request for a Field Force Canteen.</p>
      
      
      <p>Here is one of the enclosures to <span class="person">Birdwood's</span> memo.:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>  "<span class="unit">N. Z.</span> and <span class="unit">A. Division</span>."</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">I</span> desire to draw attention to the remarkable drop in the sick
         evacuations from this Brigade as shown by the following figures:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  August 28 -- 59.
         "   29 -- 64.
         "   30 -- 58.
         "   31 -- 17.
         Sept.   1 --  2.
         "    2 --  6.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">I</span> am convinced that this amelioration, and the observable improvement in
         the condition of the men are largely to be attributed to the
         distribution, on August 30 and 31 of Canteen Stores, providing a welcome
         change of dietary.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">I</span> strongly recommend that every effort be made to maintain such Canteen
         supplies.</p>

      <p> 9th September, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  At 9.30 <span class="person">Admiral de la Perriera</span> returned
         my call. At 11.50 <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>, <span class="person">Freddy</span> and I went aboard the <span class="location">Gaulois</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>[Illustration: FISH FROM THE ENEMY,  "Central News" phot. ]</p>
      
      
      <p>A five course lunch and I had to make a speech in French.</p>
      
      
      <p>When I got back I found that General <span class="person">Marshall</span>, commanding the <span class="unit">53rd Division
            Division</span>, had come over from <span class="location">Suvla</span> to stay with me. <span class="person">Lancelot Lowther</span>
         dined; <span class="person">he</span> told us all the important things <span class="person">he</span> was doing.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 10th September, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  <span class="person">Lancelot Lowther</span> left with the Mails at
         7 a.m., glad, I suspect, to shake from <span class="person">his</span> feet the sand of these
         barbaric Headquarters.</p>
      
      
      <p>Not easy to get <span class="person">Marshall</span> to loosen <span class="person">his</span> tongue about the battle of the
         21st, and <span class="person">he</span> would not, or could not, add much to my knowledge. The
         strength of <span class="person">Marshall</span> depends not on what <span class="person">he</span> seems but upon what <span class="person">his</span>
         officers and men know. <span class="person">He</span> has got <span class="person">his</span> chance amidst the realities of
         war. In peace, except by a miracle, <span class="person">he</span> would never have risen above the
         command of a Battalion. The main reason I cannot draw him about the
         battle of the 21st is, beyond doubt, that <span class="person">he</span> does not want to throw
         blame on others.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Marshall</span> is a matter-of-fact, unemotional sort of chap, yet <span class="person">he</span> told the
         sad tale of young <span class="person">O'Sullivan's</span> death in a way which touched our hearts.
         <span class="person">O'Sullivan</span> was no novice where V.C.s were the stake and the forfeit
         sudden death.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 11th September, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  Ran across in the motor boat to see the
         86th Brigade under Brigadier-General <span class="person">Percival</span>. Went, man by man, down
         the lines of the four battalions--no very long walk either! These were
         the Royal Fusiliers (Major <span class="person">Guyon</span>), Dublin Fusiliers (Colonel <span class="person">O'Dowda</span>),
         Munster Fusiliers (Major <span class="person">Geddes</span>), Lancashire Fusiliers (Major <span class="person">Pearson</span>).</p>
      
      
      <p>Shade of Napoleon--say, which would you rather not have, a skeleton
         Brigade or a Brigade of skeletons? This famous 86th Brigade is a
         combination. Were I a fat man I could not bear it, but I am as
         unsubstantial as they themselves. A life insurance office wouldn't touch
         us; and yet--they kept on smiling!</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 12th September, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  The C.O.'s, <span class="person">Geddes</span>, <span class="person">Pearson</span>, <span class="person">Guyon</span> and
         <span class="person">O'Dowda</span>, lunched: an ideal lot; young, ardent, on the spot. <span class="person">Marshall</span>
         left by the <span class="location">Suvla</span> trawler. Windy day, but calmer in the evening and at
         night rained a little.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 13th September, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  Crossed again with <span class="person">Freddie</span> Maitland and
         inspected the 87th Field Ambulance (Highland Territorials from <span class="location">Aberdeen</span>)
         under <span class="person">"Colonel Fraser.</span> Became so interested the dinner hour was
         forgotten--a bad mark for a General. Much pleased with the whole show:
         up to date, and complete in all respects. Got back lateish. <span class="person">Altham</span>
         dined. Sat up at business till midnight.</p>
      
      
      <p>Dictated a long letter to <span class="person">Callwell</span>, Director of Military Operations at
         the War Office, on the suicidal behaviour of the Military Censor. In
         <span class="location">South Africa</span>, my Chief of the Staff's latchkey let many a clandestine
         tit-bit slip through to keep interest alive in <span class="location">England</span>. <span class="person">Lord K.</span> regularly,
         when the mails came back to roost, went for me, but the messages had got
         home and done their duty as good little tit-bits should. The B.P. cannot
         work up the full steam of their war energy when the furnaces of their
         enthusiasms are systematically damped down; shut off from any breath
         from outside. Your sealed pattern censor sees nothing beyond the
         mischief that may happen if the enemy gets to know too much about us; he
         does not see that this danger is negligible when compared with the
         keenness or dullness of the nation.</p>
      
      
      <p>                       General Headquarters,
         Medtn. Expeditionary Force,
         13th September, 1915.</p>
      
      
      <p>  "Dear <span class="person">Callwell</span>,</p>
      
      
      <p>"I am about to commit an atrocity by writing to an overworked man on a
         subject which may seem to him of secondary importance. Still, to the
         soldiers out here, the said subject means encouragement or
         discouragement coming to them through the medium of their home
         letters,--so vital a factor in victory or failure that the thought
         emboldens me to proceed.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Our misfire of last month came within only a fine hair's breadth of the
         grand coup and caused us proportionately bitter disappointment at the
         moment. Yet, looking back over the whole affair in a more calm and
         philosophical spirit, any General, I think, would now be bound to admit
         that in some respects at least fortune had not been too unkind.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The <span class="location">Australians</span> and <span class="location">New Zealanders</span> have been extricated from what by
         all the laws and traditions of war, was, in theory, an untenable
         position; their borders have been enlarged; the heights they hold have
         become more elevated and commanding; they have been entirely released
         from shelling on the one flank and, on the other, the shelling has
         dwindled away to next door to nothing. North of them again we have
         captured a more or less practicable winter harbour, and have extended
         our grip on the coastline. From the extreme South point of <span class="location">Anzacs</span> to
         their extreme North was formerly 2-3/4 miles. From the extreme South
         point of <span class="location">Anzacs</span> to our extreme North point (along which there is
         inter-communication) is now 13 miles. Thus we force the enemy to
         maintain a much larger number of troops on the <span class="location">Peninsula</span> (where he is
         already slowly bleeding to death under the stress of his supply and
         transport difficulties) or else dangerously to weaken parts of his line.</p>
      
      
      <p>"As to the fighting by which this has been accomplished, there is
         nothing from beginning to end that any army need be ashamed of. Every
         word I sent home in my Proemial cables might have been published without
         raising a blush to the cheek of the most ardent Imperialist. In saying
         this I do not, of course, assume that raw troops could tackle a totally
         strange and uncomfortable proposition with the swift directness and
         savvy of veterans. The feat performed by the <span class="location">Australians</span> and New
         Zealanders was of the class of the storming of the heights of Abraham,
         only it was infinitely, infinitely more difficult in every respect.</p>
      
      
      <p>"On the other side, still assuming the philosophical mantle, consider
         what might have happened. Had the <span class="location">Australians</span> and <span class="location">New Zealanders</span> been
         average troops, they would perhaps have burst through the first series
         of wire entanglements and trenches, but they would not have stormed the
         second, still less the third, fourth, fifth or sixth lines. Again, had
         the Turks got the smallest inkling of our intention, the landing at
         <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay would have failed altogether, and the New Armies would have
         been virtually smashed to pieces without being able to show any  quid
         pro quo .</p>
      
      
      <p>"We soldiers out here have then it seems to me, much for which to thank
         God on our bended knees. That, at least, is my personal attitude.</p>
      
      
      <p>"How is it then that our letters from home are filled with lamentations
         and that, having just gained a proportionately very large accretion of
         territory, we see headlines in the papers such as 'The <span class="location">Gallipoli</span>
         standstill,' whereas it does not seem to occur to anyone to speak about
         'The French standstill'?</p>
      
      
      <p>"Well, I will tell you. The system upon which the Press Bureau
         approaches the eagerly attentive ear of the <span class="location">British</span> Public is the
         reason.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Why I begged the War Office to change the method by which I sent copies
         of my Proemial cables to <span class="person">Maxwell</span> was that I found <span class="person">he</span> (animated, of
         course, by the best intentions) was improving the successes and
         minimising the failures. The finishing touch was given when, one day, <span class="person">he</span>
         inserted the phrase 'The enemy is demoralized and has to submit by day
         and by night to our taking his trenches.' Obviously, even the most
         stupid fellaheen after reading such a sentence must, in the course of
         time, begin to ask himself how, if trenches are being easily taken by
         day and by night, we still remain on the wrong side of <span class="location">Achi Baba</span>!</p>
      
      
      <p>"Turning now to the Press Bureau and our landing, there was nothing in
         that landing, as I have just said, which need have caused sorrow to a
         soul in the <span class="location">British</span> Isles excepting, of course, the deplorable heavy
         casualties which are inseparable now from making any attack. But, on the
         23rd of August a correspondent cables to an American paper a sensational
         story of a decisive victory, which the Press Bureau must have known to
         be a tissue of lies. Had the lies taken the shape of disasters to the
         <span class="location">British</span> there would not, from the point of view of us soldiers, have
         been the smallest objection to publishing them. Suppose Mr. X, for
         instance, had said that the landing did not succeed, and had been driven
         off with immense slaughter? Apart from the fact that such a cable would
         have made many poor women in <span class="location">England</span> unhappy for a few hours, the
         fabrication would have done us positive good: when the truth was known
         the relief would have been enormous, we would have gained handsome
         recognition of what had actually been done, and German inspired lies
         would have been discounted in future.</p>
      
      
      <p>"But there is no  moral  in the world that can stand against a carefully
         engineered disappointment. When you know perfectly well that the spirits
         of the people are bound to be dashed down to the depths within a few
         days, it is unsound statesmanship surely so to engineer the Press that
         you raise those selfsame spirits sky high in the meantime. To climb up
         and up is a funny way to prepare for a fall! If you know that your
         balloon must burst in five minutes you use that time in letting out gas,
         not in throwing away ballast. If you want to spoil a man's legacy of
         £500 tell him the previous evening he has been left £50,000!</p>
      
      
      <p>"As I began by saying, do please forgive me, my dear <span class="person">Callwell</span>, for
         taking up your most precious time. But <span class="person">you</span> are more in touch with this
         particular business than anyone else at the War Office and, from <span class="person">your</span> 
         large mindedness, I feel sure you will be able to spare me some
         sympathy, and perhaps even get some recognition for the general
         principle I herewith put forward:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"(1). Do not too curiously censor false alarmist reports put about by
         the enemy. Let the papers publish them with a query and then smash them
         as soon as this can be done with positive certainty.</p>
      
      
      <p>"(2). Mercilessly censor any report which you think is, even in the
         smallest degree, overstating your own case.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The system needs courage but, with the <span class="location">British</span> Public, it would pay!</p>
      
      
      <p>                           "Yours sincerely,
         ( Sd. ), "IAN HAMILTON."</p>
      
      
      <p>As suspense had, by now, become unbearable, cabled home asking S. of S.
         to "let me know, as soon as you can safely do so," when the new
         divisions may be expected. I tell him I have "informal" news from the
         French but dare not take action on that.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 14th September, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  Mails in with Ward as King's Messenger.
         <span class="person">Captain Vitali</span> (Italian liaison officer) and <span class="person">Captain Williams</span> dined.
         <span class="person">Vitali</span> is worried about <span class="person">his</span> status. <span class="person">He</span> was told in the first instance <span class="person">he</span>
         was to be liaison officer between General <span class="person">Cadorna</span> and myself. On this
         understanding we agreed to <span class="person">his</span> coming to our Headquarters. Once <span class="person">he</span> was
         here the Italian Government (not <span class="person">Cadorna</span> <span class="person">he</span> is careful to explain) said
         <span class="person">he</span> must be permanently attached to us. <span class="person">Vitali</span> feels himself in a false
         position as <span class="person">he</span> thinks that,--had we known, we might not have let him
         come. Personally, I am quite glad to have him; but we did not have much
         talk as, immediately after dinner, <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> brought me the decipher
         of <span class="person">Lord K.</span>'s answer to my reminder to him. This has greatly saddened me
         and takes up the whole of my thoughts.</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. 7843, cipher). From <span class="person">Earl Kitchener</span> to General Sir <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span>.
         Reference your No. M.F. 630. I have just returned from <span class="location">France</span> where I
         went to settle up the questions asked in that telegram which were in a
         very indefinite state owing apparently to a decision having been arrived
         at by the French Government without reference to their military
         advisers. The outcome of my meeting with <span class="person">Millerand</span>, <span class="person">Joffre</span> and <span class="person">Sarrail</span>
         was that the French force of four Divisions proposed to be sent to the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> cannot leave until the result of the approaching offensive
         in <span class="location">France</span> is determined. If it be as successful as hoped for your
         position in the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> would naturally be affected favourably. It
         is hoped that the issue will be clear in the first few days of October,
         and if indecisive, that by 10th October two of our Divisions may be at
         Marseilles for embarkation to be followed closely by the four French
         Divisions. The embarkation and transport of so large a force would, it
         is thought, take about a month, but this has still to be worked out in
         detail, so that by about the middle of November would be the time when
         all would be ready.</p>
      
      
      <p>"In the meantime, as transport is available, I shall continue to send
         you reinforcements and drafts of which you are fully informed, up to
         20th instant, and on which you should alone calculate.</p>
      
      
      <p>"<span class="person">Sarrail</span>, backed by General <span class="person">Bailloud</span>, is greatly in favour of the French
         expedition being employed independently on the Asiatic shore.</p>
      
      
      <p>"<span class="person">Joffre</span> greatly doubts the wisdom of this course, and <span class="person">Millerand</span>
         requested me to ask you to state fully and confidentially, for his
         personal information, your opinion on this matter.</p>
      
      
      <p>"<span class="person">Joffre</span>'s objections appear to be that a landing in Asia opens up a very
         wide field if the force be not immediately successful, and that in that
         case more troops, munitions and drafts would be eventually required than
         <span class="person">he</span> could spare with due regard to the safety of <span class="location">France</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Secondly, <span class="person">he</span> is not very confident of <span class="person">Sarrail</span>'s leadership,
         particularly as the plans <span class="person">Sarrail</span> has made seem to be worthless. <span class="person">Joffre</span>
         is having careful plans worked out by <span class="person">his</span> Staff for the expedition on
         the Asiatic shore which, <span class="person">he</span> says, though unfinished, do not look
         promising. The same objection on <span class="person">his</span> part would not, I gather, be felt
         if the French troops were given a definite area and objective on the
         <span class="location">Gallipoli</span> Peninsula, where the scope of their activities, and
         consequently the support required from <span class="location">France</span>, could be limited."</p>
      
      
      <p>Where's the use of M. <span class="person">Millerand</span>'s consulting me over what lies on the
         far side of a dead wall? Had <span class="person">he</span> asked me to show why action here should
         have priority over action in <span class="location">France</span>, then I might have been of some use.
         But that is settled: the four French Divisions earmarked for the East
         will not now be sent until  after  "the results of the coming offensive
         in <span class="location">France</span> have been determined." "If the success of this push equals
         expectations you will reap the benefit." If indecisive then, "by the
         10th October," two <span class="location">British</span> Divisions and four French Divisions will be
         at Marseilles ready to sail out here: "about the middle of November
         would be the time when everything would be ready." There are altogether
         too many ifs and ands and pots and pans about <span class="person">Millerand</span>'s question.
         When a man starts going West who can foretell how long it will take him
         to arrive at the East?</p>
      
      
      <p>(1) If the push in the West is victorious we will score, says <span class="person">Lord K.</span> That is
         so. Far as the Western battlefield lies from the scene of our struggle,
         the report of a German defeat in <span class="location">France</span> would reverberate Eastwards and
         would lend us a brave moral impetus. But the point I would raise is
         this:--did <span class="person">Lord K.</span>, as representing a huge Eastern Empire, press firmly upon
         <span class="person">Millerand</span> and <span class="person">Joffre</span> the alternative,-- if the push in the East is
         victorious the West will score ?</p>
      
      
      <p>What express strategical gain do they expect from pushing back the
         Germans? A blow which merely destroys a proportion of men and material
         without paralysing the resources of the enemy is a blow in the air. War
         cannot be waged by tactics alone. That is a barbaric method. To bend
         back the German lines in the West, or to push the first line back on to
         the second or third, or twentieth, has of itself but slight strategical
         or economic import.</p>
      
      
      <p>Here, on the other hand, we have literally in our grasp a clear cut gift
         offered us by the Gods. The impossible part, the landing, is done. All
         that remains is so many fresh men and so many thousand shell. The result
         is not problematical, but mathematical. Napoleon is the only man who has
         waged a world war in the world as we know it to-day. Napoleon said, I
         think it was on the famous raft, "Who holds <span class="location">Constantinople</span> is master of
         the world." And there it lies at the mercy of the Briton--could he only
         convince <span class="person">Joffre</span> that the shortest cut to freeing <span class="person">his</span> country from the
         Germans lies through the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>The principles which should underlie Entente strategy will be clear to
         military historians although obscured to-day by jealousies and
         amateurishness: just the usual one, two, three they are, in this
         order:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>(a) Hold the sea.</p>
      
      
      <p>(b) Hold the West.</p>
      
      
      <p>(c) Smash the Turk.</p>
      
      
      <p>A couple of miles won by us here gives <span class="location">England</span> wheat and <span class="location">Russia</span> rifles;
         gives us the whip hand in the Balkans plus security in a couple of
         Continents. A couple of miles lost by us here leaves the German with a
         strengthened grip upon all the real world objectives for which he went
         to war: it leaves us with a ruined prestige in Asia. But what is all
         that to <span class="person">Joffre</span> to whom, as a good Frenchman, the Balkans; the bracing up
         of the Russian Army; all the Odessa corn; Asia and Africa thrown in, do
         not count against  one departement  of  la Patrie .</p>
      
      
      <p>(2) If the push in the West is indecisive then our push is only to be
         postponed. Postponed! The word is like a knell. To write it gives me a
         feeling of sick despair. Only postponed! As well cable at once,  only 
         ruined!!</p>
      
      
      <p>(3) But there is a third eventuality not mentioned by <span class="person">Lord K.</span> How if our
         attack upon the main strength of the entrenched Germans is beaten off?
         To <span class="person">Joffre</span> <span class="location">France</span> comes first and the rest nowhere--every time: that
         is natural. But our Higher Direction are not Frenchmen--not yet!
         Armageddon is actually being fought  here , at the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>, and the
         <span class="location">British</span> outlook is focused on <span class="location">France</span>. We are to sit here and rot away
         with cholera, and see the winter gales approach, until the big push has
         been made in the West where men can afford to wait--where they are
         healthy--where time is all on their side. And this push in the West is
         against the whole <span class="location">German Empire</span> linked to all its own vast resources by
         a few miles of the best railways in the world. We  can  attack here with
         more men and more munitions than the enemy the very moment we care to
         accept the principle that,  at this moment , <span class="location">Constantinople</span> and the
         heartening up of <span class="location">Russia</span> and ascendency amongst the Balkan States are not
         only the true positive objectives of our strategy, but are the sole
         strategical stunts upon the board. We can do so because of our sea
         power. We can borrow enough howitzers, aeroplanes, munitions and drafts
         from the West; apply them here and then, if necessary, return them. We
         are not exploiting our own special characteristics, mobility and sea
         power!</p>
      
      
      <p>[Illustration: MARSHALL LIMAN VON SANDERS  "Exclusive News" phot. ]</p>
      
      
      <p>Easy to preach patience to a nation in agony? Yes, for the whole agony
         of the whole world is more important even than the agonies of <span class="location">France</span>.
         We've got to win the war and win it quick. There's only one way to do
         that. The resources of the Entente are not equal to carrying on two
         offensives at the same moment. If our Army in the West will just sit
         tight awhile, we here will beat the Turks, and snip the last economic
         lien binding the Central Powers to the outside world.</p>
      
      
      <p>Once more, our game is to  defend  in the West until the  attack  in the
         East has borne economic fruit in the shape of ships and corn: political
         fruit in the sentiment of the Balkans: military fruit in the fillip
         given to the whole force of the Entente by actual tactical contact
         between the <span class="location">British</span> soldiers and the rank and file of the Ruskies. The
         collapse of the Central Powers,--eclipsed in full view of all Asia and
         Africa by the smoke from the funnels of the <span class="location">British</span> Fleet at anchor in
         the Golden Horn is what we are after here. Even if French and <span class="person">Joffre</span> do
         drive the German main hordes back to the Rhine the scope of their scoop
         would be far less than ours, for we by getting to <span class="location">Constantinople</span> can
         starve those main armies stiff.</p>
      
      
      <p>How few of our people know anything of the Russians. At least, I have
         been attached for eight months to the Armies which fought against them
         in the field; have visited <span class="location">Russia</span> and Siberia and have done two peace
         manoeuvres as their guest. To send superior officers to <span class="location">Russia</span> only
         produces jealousy; to send supplies only breeds dishonesty. But with
         50,000 <span class="location">British</span> soldiers as yeast we could leaven 5,000,000 Muscovites;
         we could fire their inert masses with our ardour; this is the best of
         all uses to which 50,000 <span class="location">British</span> soldiers could at present be put.</p>
      
      
      <p>From the early days when <span class="person">he</span> told me the New Army should go to <span class="location">Salonika</span>,
         <span class="person">Lord K.</span> had an intuition at the back of <span class="person">his</span> big mind that victory would dawn
         in the East. But <span class="person">he</span> is no longer the <span class="person">Lord K.</span> of <span class="person">Lord K.</span>, the old <span class="person">Lord K.</span> of Khartoum
         and Pretoria. <span class="person">He</span> still has <span class="person">his</span> moments of God-sent intuition. First, <span class="person">he</span>
         had  absolute  knowledge that the Germans would come through Belgium: I
         repeat this. The assumption was not uncommon perhaps, but he  knew the
         fact ! Secondly, when everyone else spoke of a six weeks' war; when
         every other soldier I can think of except <span class="person">Douglas Haig</span> believed he'd be
         back before the grouse shooting was over; <span class="person">Lord K.</span> went nap on a three years'
         war. Pray heaven <span class="person">he</span> was wrong; but, right or wrong, <span class="person">he</span> has already
         proved himself to have been nearer the mark than anyone else. Thirdly,
         he had a call (by heavenly telepathy, I suppose) that his New Armies
         must go out to the East. There is no more question about this than there
         is about Belgium and the three years' duration. <span class="person">He</span> has told me so; time
         and again.</p>
      
      
      <p>Why then does <span class="person">he</span> not act accordingly if he's in the Almighty know?
         Because <span class="person">he</span> can't. With the one exception of the Battle of <span class="location">Paardeberg</span>, <span class="person">he</span>
         never in <span class="person">his</span> palmiest days pretended to be a man of action. But now <span class="person">he</span>
         has lost <span class="person">his</span> faculty of forcing others to act. <span class="person">He</span> makes a spurt but <span class="person">he</span>
         can't stay the distance. <span class="person">He</span> has met <span class="person">Millerand</span>, French and <span class="person">Joffre</span> in
         Council and allowed the searchlights of <span class="person">his</span> genius to be snuffed out!
         That is what surprises me:--<span class="person">He</span>, who once could deflect <span class="person">Joe Chamberlain</span>
         and <span class="person">Milner</span> from their orbits; who twisted stiff-necked Boers round his
         little finger; who bore down <span class="person">Asquith</span>, <span class="person">Winston</span>, <span class="person">Prince Louis</span> and <span class="person">Beatty</span>
         in Valetta Harbour--East  versus  West--Mediterranean  versus  N/orth
         Sea--who, from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m., withstood, wrestled with and overthrew
         Haldane's arguments in favour of his taking up the succession to the
         <span class="person">Duke of Connaught,</span> and that although <span class="person">he</span> had one arm tied to <span class="person">his</span> side by
         having taken the King's shilling. What a marvel <span class="person">he</span> was and now--</p>
      
      
      <p>  Ichabod!</p>
      
      
      <p>There is something so tragical in what home letters let us guess that
         the pity of it almost makes me forget our own stillborn projects.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 15th September, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  <span class="person">Altham</span> and <span class="person">Major Hood</span> left G.H.Q. for L.
         of C. Headquarters. Had another hour with <span class="person">Altham</span> before <span class="person">he</span> got aboard
         <span class="person">his</span> destroyer. Gave an interview to <span class="person">Buchanan</span>, A.M.S. After lunch,
         <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>, <span class="person">Val</span>, <span class="person">Wells</span>, <span class="person">Deedes</span>, <span class="person">Freddie</span> and <span class="person">myself</span> went off to <span class="location">Suvla</span>
         aboard <span class="location">H.M.S.  Scourge</span> (Lieutenant-Commander Tupper). On landing,
         <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> branched off to see the G.S. <span class="person">Byng</span> has a keen sense of
         humour; is energetic and by <span class="person">his</span> looks and manner attracts all ranks. No
         one could wish a better corps commander and I have never in all my
         experience known anyone take greater and more minute trouble with <span class="person">his</span>
         field days and manoeuvres than <span class="person">he</span> did in <span class="location">Egypt</span> the year before the
         war. But <span class="person">his</span> sojourn on the Western front has given him inflated
         standards as to the number of guns and stocks of H.E. shell which are
         essential to success; especially with troops who have suffered heavy
         losses. Perhaps <span class="person">he</span> is right. This para. from a letter written to the
         great man to-night explains more generally what I feel:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"<span class="person">Maude</span> is burning to get on and do something and I heard him myself ask
         <span class="person">Byng</span> when <span class="person">he</span> was going to let him have a dash. As to <span class="person">Byng</span>, I think
         myself <span class="person">he</span> is not quite sure yet about the spirit of <span class="person">his</span> men. I have been
         trying to spur <span class="person">him</span> on for the last day or so, although only by very
         gentle hints, as I think, with a man of <span class="person">Byng</span>'s great reputation, one
         must leave <span class="person">him</span> to <span class="person">himself</span> for as long as possible. I daresay <span class="person">he</span> may be
         quite right and very wise. Still, these reinforcements have brought the
         <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay troops up to no less than 37,000 men, and I am most anxious
         they should do something soon a little more rapid than sapping out
         slowly towards the enemy's lines--which they are doing."</p>
      
      
      <p>After my talk with <span class="person">Byng</span>, we went on to meet <span class="person">Fanshawe</span> and <span class="person">de Lisle</span>. <span class="person">Maude</span>
         came along with me as far as the crestline. I asked <span class="person">him</span> about <span class="person">his</span>
         Division. <span class="person">He</span> replied: "Sir <span class="person">Ian</span>, may <span class="person">I</span> be frank with you about the
         Division?" At these ominous words I shivered. They positively gave me
         he shivers. So I braced myself up when I answered, "But of course!"
         <span class="person">Maude</span> then said, "If you give the order now, and will arrange for a
         little artillery support, <span class="person">my</span> Division will storm and hold on to any
         thousand yards of <span class="location">Turkish</span> trench you like to point out; to-morrow." I
         could have embraced him, but I had to go steady and explain to <span class="person">him</span> that
         a Corps Commander must judge all his Divisions and that, taking the
         situation as a whole, <span class="person">Byng</span> did not think it fair on the men to let them
         have a dart yet--not, at least, till they had more munitions at their
         back. <span class="person">Byng</span> has had wide experiences in the West and <span class="person">he</span> looks on it as
         trying the men unfairly to ask them to attack without a preliminary
         bombardment on a scale which we cannot at present afford. "Yes," said
         <span class="person">Maude</span>, "that is all very well but after all you must remember the Turks
         have neither the artillery nor the munitions the Germans have at their
         command on the Western front."</p>
      
      
      <p>"Well," I replied, "you put your points to <span class="person">Byng</span> and you know I am a man
         who never yet in my life refused a good brave offer like yours." <span class="person">He</span> has
         a great admiration for <span class="person">Byng</span> and so, though sadly, <span class="person">he</span> went away.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Fanshawe</span> met me at the South end of the Division trenches, as bright and
         keen as a new nail. His men, too, seem full of go. <span class="person">Fanshawe</span> hopes to
         carry the whole ridge whenever <span class="person">he</span> gets the order. The <span class="unit">11th Division</span>
         promise to be as fine a unit as any in the Army once they get their gaps
         filled in.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 16th September, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  We had quite a lively morning here. At
         7.30 an enemy's biplane dropped four bombs on our Headquarters camp and
         got away with hardly a shot fired at it. At 7.50 an enemy's Taube came
         over and dropped bombs near my Signal Tent, also a little summer shower
         of small steel darts: five men were wounded. At 8.10 a.m. yet another
         enemy biplane circled round but was kept at a respectful distance by the
         ship's guns.</p>
      
      
      <p>Gave an interview to <span class="person">Colonel Stewart</span>, Armoured Car Squadron.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Vice-Admiral Foumet</span> and Staff called on me in the forenoon. <span class="person">He</span> replaces
         <span class="person">Admiral Nicol</span> gone sick. Mails went out this evening. <span class="person">Freddie</span> and I
         gave tone to our debilitated constitutions by dining with the ever
         hospitable V.A. on the  <span class="location">Triad</span> .</p>
      
      
      <p>A cable from <span class="person">Dawnay</span> saying <span class="person">Lord K.</span> "would not regard unfavourably" a
         withdrawal from <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Dawnay</span> left under the cloud of the 21st August. <span class="person">He</span> it was who
         rough-drafted the cable (in very much stronger terms than my final
         version) suggesting that we might have to draw in our horns if we were
         not kept up to strength. Since then our skies have cleared; the spirit
         of the men has risen to set fair and we have got drafts enough, not for
         a big push but certainly to enable us to be delighted should the Turks
         attempt any sort of an attack, either at <span class="location">Suvla</span> or anywhere else. The
         Turks, in fact, are strictly on the defensive both actually and in their
         spirit.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 17th September, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  Had been going to <span class="location">Anzac</span> to inspect and
         then to bring <span class="person">Birdie</span> back to stay with me. But the weather was too bad.
         <span class="person">He</span> got here all right as the wind is from the North and he was able to
         climb aboard under the lee of Nibrunesi Point. Just as well, perhaps, we
         did not go, for one way or another a good deal of extra work had to be
         got through. One thing; two cables from <span class="person">Maxwell</span> to the War Office have
         been repeated to us here; inadvertently we think; divertingly for sure.
         The story is this:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>A few days ago we were offered the <span class="unit">51st</span> and <span class="unit">53rd Sikhs</span> who, despite
         their titles, are half Mahomedan. After consulting <span class="person">Cox</span>, <span class="person">Birdie</span> and
         other <span class="location">Indian</span> Army Officers I cabled back saying we would gladly have
         them "as soon as transport can be arranged," unless French is willing to
         exchange them for two purely non-Mahomedan units. Here are the
         collateral cables from <span class="person">Maxwell</span> to the War Office:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"Both the <span class="unit">51st</span> and <span class="unit">53rd Sikhs</span> have already been disembarked. They had
         better remain off ship as long as possible, I think, since they are
         reported to be feverish. The troopship can wait at Port Said. The men on
         the canal, I should like to point out, barely get two nights in bed per
         week."</p>
      
      
      <p>"I have been asked by Hamilton to send him a double Company of Patiala
         Sikhs to reinforce the <span class="unit">14th Sikhs.</span> I can do this, and if you concur I
         think it is a better arrangement than to send him the <span class="unit">51st</span> and <span class="unit">53rd</span>
         Sikhs."</p>
      
      
      <p>The Sikhs meant for <span class="location">Gallipoli</span> are gone; we shall never see them more;
         they mount guard by night against the ghosts of the Suez Canal.</p>
      
      
      <p>Another thing; a Correspondent writes in and tells us that for the
         honour of his profession he feels bound to let us know that <span class="person">Mr.
            Ashmead-Bartlett</span> has secretly sent home an uncensored despatch  per , of
         all people in the world, Mr.<span class="person">Murdoch</span>!</p>
      
      
      <p>I had begun to wonder what had come over Mr.<span class="person">Murdoch</span> and now it seems <span class="person">he</span>
         has come over me!</p>
      
      
      <p>The next paper on the table was my draft cable of advice for M.
         <span class="person">Millerand</span>. <span class="person">Joffre</span> wants <span class="person">his</span> four Divisions to land on the Peninsula;
         <span class="person">Sarrail</span> wishes them to work along the Asiatic side. No doubt the views
         of the French Generals are being coloured by their wish to stand as
         clear as they can of <span class="location">British</span> command. So I have been careful to sweep
         away  that  obstacle by offering to stand down. Now they can fix up the
         problem on its merits:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"Closest consideration has been given to your No. 7843, cipher. Until
         now I have consistently opposed a landing on the Asiatic side of the
         <span class="location">Straits</span> with less than 6 divisions--see my telegram No. M.F. 349 of 19th
         June. On <span class="location">Gallipoli</span> Peninsula area and difficulties of supply limited
         liabilities of the opposing forces whereas mainland of Asia gave scope
         for the deployment of large forces by the enemy. Now, however, the
         situation is clearing up and there has been a great change in the
         conditions.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The Turks had formerly 10,000 to 12,000 men on Asiatic shore with large
         reserves on the Peninsula available to cross over there if necessary.
         Now Anatolia and Syria have been drained of troops to oppose us on the
         Peninsula where the Turks have far longer front to hold, namely, 9-1/2
         miles instead of 2-1/2, whilst our position and strength at <span class="location">Suvla</span> and
         Anzac are more threatening to their communications than was our position
         at Anzac in June. If, therefore, we can be strong enough to maintain
         pressure on whole <span class="location">Turkish</span> line on the Peninsula it is unlikely that
         Turks could detach troops to oppose French landing on Asiatic shore.
         Assuming even that the Turks were enabled to release every soldier from
         Thrace by a definite understanding being arrived at with <span class="location">Bulgaria</span>, I
         calculate they might gather a total of five divisions but of these
         probably only one or at most two would be on Asiatic side at beginning
         of the operations and would probably be scattered so that opposition in
         strength to surprise landing is improbable. Moreover, only one of the
         divisions is composed of good Nizam troops, others believed to be not up
         to establishment. The Asiatic coast down to Yukeri Bay is now heavily
         trenched but I do not think much has been done below that point.
         Supposing, therefore, French bring good divisions at war strength and
         succeed in keeping their destination secret, they appear to have a good
         chance of obtaining good covering positions without much loss and of
         thence advancing on Chanak defeating any <span class="location">Turkish</span> forces sent against
         them. Degree of their success would depend on whether the entrenched
         positions which have been prepared on the Kum Kale--Ehren Keui road
         could be turned by the good road which leads from <span class="location">Yukeri</span> through <span class="location">Ezine</span>
         and <span class="location">Ishiklar</span> to <span class="location">Chanak</span>, as it is unlikely that Turks would be able to
         quickly organize new defensive positions with entirely new line of
         supply. The distance of landing place from objective is a secondary
         consideration. It is easier to march and fight 100 miles than to take
         three lines of trenches. In the one case there is room for manoeuvre
         at which Turks are bad while in the other case siege warfare results at
         which the Turks stand supreme. Once Ehren Keui reached, the Turks
         between that place and<span class="location"> Kum Kale </span>would be forced to retire and Kum Kale
         would become our base, thereby greatly shortening line of supply.
         Supposing Turks endeavoured to make bridgehead on <span class="location">Chanak</span> promontory, the
         country is so big that large forces would be necessary and once the
         Turks were cut off from North their supply difficulties would be most
         serious. French possession of Chanak should be equivalent to victory,
         but as Turks are stubborn fellows it is better to confine anticipations
         to commencement of results which I consider would be as
         follows:--Cutting off of <span class="location">Turkish</span> supply line Chanak to Akbashi Liman.
         Narrows would be useless to Turks. Nagara communications could be cut.
         Our 15-inch howitzer could be used to batter Kilid Bahr forts. Allied
         Fleets should be able to enter <span class="location">Marmora</span> without loss.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Turning to alternatives. If French were held up and unable to reach
         <span class="location">Chanak</span>, at least the last <span class="location">Turkish</span> reserves would have been used up and I
         think happy termination of operations though postponed would begin to
         come clearly into view. Supposing the worst happened and that the French
         were compelled to fall back after landing. In that case a clear road for
         retirement to a bridgehead would be open. Positions covering landing
         could be taken up and there they would continue to draw towards them
         considerable <span class="location">Turkish</span> forces which would otherwise be available for use
         on <span class="location">Peninsula.</span></p>
      
      
      <p>"Finally, greater difficulties beset all other schemes. The notorious
         military disadvantages of independent command would be less harmful if
         the respective armies were separated by the Straits than if they were
         mixed up together on Peninsula. As <span class="location">Achi Baba</span> is now one of the
         strongest fortresses in Europe, it would be unpopular to palm off the
         Cape <span class="location">Helles</span> end upon the French. Moreover, all the French here are, and
         always have been, dead set on Asia. If the French were employed at <span class="location">Suvla</span>
         they would have to fight side by side with the <span class="location">British</span>, a situation
         which, with co-equal commanders, would be a military absurdity. Were
         that course decided upon, I would ask the Allied Governments to make up
         their minds which General had the most daring, brains and experience,
         and if it were the Frenchman I would serve under him loyally.</p>
      
      
      <p>"As to making the attempt to the North of the Gulf of Xeros: a landing
         there is certain to be opposed, and the <span class="location">Turkish</span> reinforcements which are
         always held ready in the neighbourhood of <span class="location">Uzunkiupru</span> and <span class="location">Keshan</span> could
         arrive in strength very quickly and imperil the whole project. A further
         objection lies in the distance of the French intermediate base and great
         strain it would throw on Allied Fleets. Finally, it is all-important
         that absolute secrecy should be maintained. I suggest that it should be
         allowed to leak out that the destination of the French is Enos, this
         would probably have the effect of tricking <span class="location">Turkish</span> troops in Thrace, as
         Enos is a destination which would gain most credence."</p>

      <p>CHAPTER XX LOOS AND SALONIKA</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Left G.H.Q. at noon to-day, 18th, sailed to <span class="location">Helles</span>; lunched with <span class="person">Davies</span>;
         went up to inspect the East Lanes Division. The trenches are in
         apple-pie order and the men are in good heart, but the stomach has
         always been held to be the mainstay of the fighting man, and theirs are
         in the grip of enteritis. Stopped at 5th Corps Headquarters on my way
         back.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">De Putron</span> and <span class="person">la Borde</span> came back with me. Struck an interesting
         scientist called <span class="person">Lawes</span> whilst I was in the Lancashire trenches. As we
         were entering the harbour at Kephalos an enemy Taube tried to drop a
         bomb aboard. No harm.</p>
      
      
      <p>Dined with the V.A. together with <span class="person">Birdie</span>, Lord <span class="person">Anglesey</span> and <span class="person">Freddie</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>When we got back found this from War Office. Rather amusing to be in the
         know of the counter moves and to see their outcome:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"The exchange of battalions mentioned in No. 7873, cipher, of 14th
         September cannot be effected, so that at present the <span class="unit">51st</span> and <span class="unit">53rd</span> Sikhs
         will not proceed to <span class="location">France</span>. From the General Officer Commanding,
         <span class="location">Egypt</span>'s, telegram No. 1854. E. of 15th September, it is understood that
         he can send you another double company of Patiala Sikhs to reinforce the
         <span class="unit">14th Sikhs.</span> Possibly this will suffice for your requirements in the
         meantime, and the <span class="unit">51st</span> and <span class="unit">53rd</span> Sikhs will be left at the disposal of
         General Officer Commanding, <span class="location">Egypt</span>. If so, will you please make
         arrangements with him accordingly?</p>
      
      
      <p>"Repeated to General Officer Commanding, <span class="location">Egypt</span>."</p>
      
      
      <p>Our defeat is a foregone conclusion: the Senoussi is too strong for us.
         All the same I am determined to press the matter to an issue, if only to
         have a clean cut precedent as to whether we do have a first call on
         troops in <span class="location">Egypt</span> or whether it is the other way about. We want these men
         so badly. They don't get sick here; are worth four European Battalions
         at present, and <span class="person">Birdie</span> has become most anxious to get them, especially
         the 53rd. So I am cabling to <span class="person">Maxwell</span> just to send us our troops (for
         they are ours) forthwith and have cabled to the War Office:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"With reference to your telegram No. 8012, cipher. In accordance with
         your telegram No. 8711, of 11th September, I am asking General Officer
         Commanding, <span class="location">Egypt</span>, to send here, at once, the <span class="unit">51st</span> and <span class="unit">53rd Sikhs</span>, as I
         cannot do without them. I shall be very glad to receive the Patiala
         Sikhs as well, as the 14th Sikhs are badly in need of a reinforcement."</p>
      
      
      <p>Imagine had we been sent <span class="location">Indian</span> Divisions for <span class="location">Suvla</span> and if the New Army,
         Territorials and Yeomen had been sent instead to <span class="location">France</span>! Each category
         would have given (let me put it mildly) double value. The heat, the
         thirst, the scrub, the snipers, all so disconcerting to our fresh
         contingents would have been commonplaces of frontier warfare to our
         <span class="location">Indian</span> troops. See what the handful with us here have achieved. Yet in
         vain do I write and cable my personal entreaties to <span class="person">Beauchamp Duff</span>, the
         all-powerful Commander-in-Chief in <span class="location">India</span>, and a very old friend, for two
         hundred Sikhs: first <span class="person">he</span> offers me a couple of hundred Brahmins wherewith
         to fill the ranks of the famous <span class="unit">14th Sikhs</span> and then, when I hesitate
         before a proposal which appears monstrous, withdraws even that offer.
         Again, I beg for 200 recruits for the <span class="unit">14th</span>, saying I will train them
         myself; I am refused--very politely and at great length--refused,
         because it would be "politically inexpedient" to send them. In vain do
         we try to get our own two battalions through the <span class="location">Egypt</span>ian morass; they
         are going to stick and do sentry go over nothing. Why; were there any
         real trouble in <span class="location">Egypt</span> I could land a whole Division there within four
         and a half days!</p>
      
      
      <p>As for the New Army and Territorials, gradually entered with their
         veteran comrades in the trenches of <span class="location">France</span> and <span class="location">Flanders</span>, they too would
         have had more familiar surroundings and fairer play--as everyone here
         now recognizes, too late!</p>
      
      
      <p>The crystals of history take shape while we fight. As in a glass darkly
         the outlines begin to appear to anyone who has a moment wherein to peer
         beyond the end of the war. Everything has gone by the contrary. Our
         people have done as well as their neighbours, and better, with their
         imaginations, whether in diplomacy, strategy or tactics. Where the
         Gibbon or Plutarch who survives the War Office Censor is going to damn
         their reputations into heaps is over their failure in business
         commonsense. Under their noses, parts of their system, were two great
         live organisms; the <span class="location">Indian</span> Army and the Territorial Force. From the
         moment the mobilization flag was dropped it was up to them to work tooth
         and nail to treble or quadruple these sound, vigorous existing entities.
         What have they done? After a year of war, the <span class="location">Indian</span> Army and the
         Territorial Army are staggering on their last legs instead of being the
         best part of our forces. Compare the <span class="unit">East Lanes Division</span>, who had the
         good fortune to escape from War Office clutches by getting right out to
         <span class="location">Egypt</span> at the outbreak of the war, with Territorial Divisions which have
         remained since then under the eyes and in the hands of the War Office!</p>
      
      
      <p>The Turks are still withdrawing troops from the Caucasus front to ours.
         Good for the Russians. Whilst I was at <span class="location">Helles</span>, the enemy guns started a
         heavy bombardment along the whole of our nine mile front from the right
         of <span class="location">Anzac</span> to the left of <span class="location">Suvla</span>; a heavy musketry fire also along the
         <span class="location">Turkish</span> trenches. An attempt was then made to launch infantry assaults
         against our lines, but these fizzled out, the rank and file having no
         heart for the job. There is no doubt the Turks have had enough of it.
         They can still hold on, but that's about all.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 19th September, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  News in to say that the <span class="location">Turkish</span> rank and
         file at <span class="location">Suvla</span> are not equal to any attack. At the end of the bombardment
         yesterday a few officers jumped on to the parapet and waved their
         swords; the men shouted from the safety of the trenches--that was all.
         <span class="person">Alec McGrigor</span> arrived from <span class="location">Alexandria</span> as A.D.C.  vice  Brodrick. At 9
         p.m. an enemy aeroplane dropped a couple of bombs. Very jolly having
         <span class="person">Birdie</span> here. <span class="person">He</span> says that <span class="person">his</span> latest returns show a daily sick list of
         ten per battalion of <span class="location">British</span> or <span class="location">Australia</span> troops and of one per
         battalion of <span class="location">Indian</span> troops.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 20th September, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  Nothing doing. There is still scope for
         action at <span class="location">Suvla</span> but we can't get them to take up any little schemes we
         may suggest. Shell shortage is the invariable answer. At 5 p.m. <span class="person">Birdie</span>
         and <span class="person">Anglesey</span> went back to Anzac.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 21st September, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  Further development of the Sikh
         comedy:--<span class="person">Maxwell</span> cables, "No. 1883 E. Your No. M.F. 648. <span class="person">I</span> have received
         no orders to send these regiments. According to <span class="person">my</span> last information from
         the War Office they were to remain here, as <span class="person">I</span> require them, but that <span class="person">I</span>
         should send you a double company of Patiala Sikhs to reinforce the <span class="unit">14th
            Sikhs.</span>"</p>
      
      
      <p>I have cabled this on to the War Office, saying, "As I understand it,
         your No. 8012 of 18th September does not mean that the War Office have
         withdrawn the offer of these two regiments, which are urgently required
         here. I therefore hope that you will give early authority to General
         Officer Commanding, <span class="location">Egypt</span>, to send them on to Mediterranean
         Expeditionary Force."</p>
      
      
      <p>The battalions were thrown at my head when that grand statement was made
         as to the grand army I commanded; now where are they?</p>
      
      
      <p>Started off with <span class="person">Taylor</span>, <span class="person">Freddie</span> and Colonel <span class="person">Napier</span> (<span class="location">British</span> Military
         Attaché to <span class="location">Bulgaria</span>) for <span class="location">Anzac</span>. No shelling. Went round the whole left
         centre and left of <span class="person">Birdie</span>'s position to right and left of Cheshire
         Point, and saw the new <span class="location">Australia</span> Division--very fine fellows. Bullets
         were on the whistle and "the boys" were as keen and happy as any real
         schoolboys. Memories of the Khyber, Chitral and Tirah can hardly yield
         samples of a country so tangled and broken. Where the Turks begin and
         where we end is a puzzler, and if you do happen to take a wrong turning
         it leads to Paradise. Met various <span class="location">Australia</span> friends--a full-blown Lord
         Mayor--many other leading citizens both of <span class="location">Melbourne</span> and of <span class="location">Sydney</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 5 p.m. re-embarked. <span class="person">Napier</span> gave birth to a happy thought on our way
         back. His idea is that we should transfer the troops on the <span class="location">Gallipoli</span>
         Peninsula to <span class="location">Salonika</span> so as to hearten up the Serbians and Greeks and
         dishearten our enemies at <span class="location">Sofia</span>. <span class="person">He</span> has pressed <span class="person">his</span> view, <span class="person">he</span> said, on
         the Foreign Office. I asked him if <span class="person">his</span> Chief, the Minister at <span class="location">Sofia</span>,
         stood behind him. <span class="person">He</span> said <span class="person">he</span> could not vouch for <span class="person">his</span> Minister's views,
         but that <span class="person">he</span>, <span class="person">Napier</span>, had power in <span class="person">his</span> capacity as Military Attaché to
         correspond with the <span class="location">British</span> Government direct.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Lord K.</span> himself did at one time toy with the thought of sending <span class="person">his</span> New Army
         to <span class="location">Serbia</span> either under <span class="person">Rundle</span> or <span class="person">myself</span>, and was only restrained by the
         outbreak of typhus in that country. But, keen as I was for the warpath,
         a very little study of the terrain and supply question was enough to
         cool my ardour.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="location">Salonika</span> is ruled out by history. In all the campaigns waged of old in
         these very regions the part played by <span class="location">Salonika</span> has been naval, not
         military. There must have been some reason for this: there was; it still
         exists--geography! You could not, and cannot, carry out anything big
         via  a couple of narrow cracks through a trackless labyrinth of
         mountains. The problem is a repetition of the <span class="location">Afghanistan</span> dilemma. A big
         army would starve at <span class="location">Nisch</span> and along the Danube; a small army would be
         swallowed up by the enemy. Unless they are going to trust to <span class="location">Bulgaria</span>
         and <span class="location">Roumania</span> for supplies, one <span class="location">British</span> Army Corps is about as much as
         can manage to live and fight in <span class="location">Serbia</span>. If they want to make <span class="location">Serbia</span> safe
         their only possible chance is to push through to <span class="location">Constantinople</span>! There
         is no other way. I said all this to <span class="person">Napier</span> and a lot more besides and
         left him keener on <span class="location">Salonika</span> than ever.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">He</span> actually thinks that from <span class="location">Salonika</span> we could do what could be done by
         us at any time at the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>! <span class="location">Salonika</span> is no alternative to the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>. I wish the War Office could hear <span class="person">Gouraud</span>; <span class="person">Gouraud</span>, that big
         sane man with local knowledge. How strong <span class="person">he</span> used to be on the point
         that <span class="location">Greece</span> lay altogether outside the sphere of any military action by
         the Entente. We can't feed <span class="location">Russia</span> with munitions through <span class="location">Salonika</span>, nor
         can we bring back Russian wheat  via  <span class="location">Salonika</span>,--not much, seeing we
         would not be able to feed ourselves were we fifty miles into the
         mountains. <span class="location">Salonika</span> is a military mare's nest.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Scatters Wilson</span> and <span class="person">Captain Cheape</span> dined and stayed the night. The
         King's Messenger arrived with the Mails.</p>
      
      
      <p>Three cables:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F. 654). From General Sir <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span> to War Office. Only two
         machine guns per battalion are being brought by the City of <span class="location">London</span>
         battalions, the balance, by order of General Officer Commanding, <span class="location">Egypt</span>,
         being handed over to Chief Ordnance Officer, <span class="location">Egypt</span>. The former
         telegraphs that this has been done by your order. There is nothing that
         is more important to my force than an ample supply of these guns. I
         would therefore request that early authority should be given to General
         Officer Commanding, <span class="location">Egypt</span>, to send on these guns."</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. I.D. 116). From General Headquarters, Mediterranean Expeditionary
         Force, to War Office. My No. I.D. 110. Please inform me whether <span class="person">Murdoch</span>
         has arrived, and whether my information was correct as regards <span class="person">his</span>
         carrying a despatch for <span class="person">Sir Harry Lawson</span> from <span class="person">Ashmead-Bartlett</span>."</p>
      
      
      <p>"(No. 8108, cipher). From War Office to General Headquarters,
         Mediterranean Expeditionary Force. Your No. I.D. 116. A despatch
         answering the description has been taken from <span class="person">Murdoch</span> at <span class="location">Marseilles.</span> You
         should delay action, however, until we have seen it and you hear from us
         further."</p>
      
      
      <p>The despatch should have been censored here and ought, therefore, to be
         sent back here for censoring. The War Office, I suppose, want to have
         first look in!</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 22nd September, 1915.  <span class="person">Scatters</span> and <span class="person">Cheape</span> sailed back for <span class="location">Suvla</span> at
         6.45 a.m.--just in good time to avoid a raid on our Headquarters carried
         out by three Taubes between 7.50 and 8 a.m. A dozen bombs dropped; no
         serious harm done.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Heseltine</span>, King's Messenger, came to dinner.</p>
      
      
      <p>Bad news from <span class="location">Bulgaria</span>. She is mobilizing, not, we may be sure, for the
         sake of helping those who do not help themselves. Well do I remember
         <span class="person">Ferdinand</span>, as long ago as 1909, turning to me and saying as <span class="person"> he</span> pointed
         to a picture of himself in the robes of a Byzantine Emperor, " Quand
         vous arrivez au Bosphore, pensez à moi ." Well, there is one good side
         to working over a narrow <span class="location">Peninsula</span>, under the guns of your own Fleet,
         all the Bulgars in the Balkans cannot add a rifle to the number of enemy
         troops on <span class="location">Gallipoli</span>, who already, can only be munitioned, watered and
         fed with the greatest difficulty. The more targets the enemy cram on to
         their present narrow front the merrier for our gunners; the better the
         chance for our submarines starving the lot of them. So long as our Fleet
         holds the Ægean, we may snap our fingers at the Bulgarians, whereas
         they, were they fools enough to come here, would live on tenter hooks
         lest haply some fine morning our Fleet should sail into the Marmora.</p>
      
      
      <p>Yes, two or three battleships in the Marmora! Think of it! The sea
         communications, <span class="location">Constantinople</span>-<span class="location">Gallipoli</span> and Asia-<span class="location">Gallipoli</span>, would
         cease,  ipso facto , to exist. The railways between Europe and
         <span class="location">Constantinople</span> and Asia and <span class="location">Constantinople</span> must shut down. In a
         fortnight the Turks on the <span class="location">Peninsula</span> begin to pack up; in a month the
         Turks in <span class="location">Constantinople</span> move bag and baggage from Europe to Asia. 
         <span class="person">Ferdinand</span> watching the cat's jump, prepares to turn those 400,000
         bayonets of <span class="person">his</span> against the <span class="person">Kaiser</span>. So wags my world in the might-be;
         very much "might-be" for the Navy are turning down the "to be" for the
         third time of asking. Three times the Sibyl makes her prodigious offer:
         May--August--September a new world for old battleships:--two--four--six!</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 23rd September, 1915.  Stormy weather: the <span class="location"> Imogene </span> could hardly crawl
         out. Have written <span class="person">Lord K.</span> to tell him how day succeeds day, never without
         incident, but never with achievement; how we are burnt up with longing
         to get on and how we know that he is as anxious. Yet, as I tell him,
         we  "can't force the pace." How can we? We have not the
         wherewithal--the stuff. "<span class="person">Byng</span> would like to have four days' successive
         bombardment for an hour, and then attack, and speaks of one H.E. shell
         per yard as pat as if they were shells we could pick up on the seashore.
         I have assured <span class="person">him</span> it is no earthly use; that <span class="person">he</span> shall have <span class="person">his</span> share of
         what I have got, but that stuff for bombardment is simply not in
         existence,--not here, at least."</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 24th September, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  Fought against exasperation all day. As
         I thought:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"(No. 8193, cipher). From <span class="person">Earl Kitchener</span> to General Sir <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span>. In
         the existing situation, the two battalions referred to in your No. M.F.
         655 of 21st September, should remain for the present in <span class="location">Egypt</span>. I have
         informed <span class="person">Maxwell</span> to this effect."</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Lord K.</span> has re-opened the idea of giving up <span class="location">Suvla</span>, saying, "it might become
         necessary in certain eventualities to abandon that area." In my reply I
         have said, "I hope there will be no question now of the abandonment of
         <span class="location">Suvla</span>.... In the Northern zone I have now more troops than at the time
         of my telegram, my line is stronger, the old troops are resting, the new
         troops are improving, and preparations are being made for a local
         advance. At this stage withdrawal will be a great moral victory for the
         Turks. Moreover, it would release a large number of enemy divisions to
         oppose the Russians in Asia, or for other enterprises."</p>
      
      
      <p>Another cable also sent dealing with the ever present, ever pressing,
         ever ghastlier shortage upon the Peninsula generally:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"My present shortages, 21st September, of infantry rank and file are
         2,645 in the <span class="unit">XXIXth Division</span>, 17,166 in the three New Army Divisions,
         and 23,986 in the four Territorial Divisions, totalling 43,797; out of
         respective establishments of 11,652, 37,869 and 44,824, total, 97,345."</p>
      
      
      <p>Were the <span class="unit">Royal Naval Division</span> included the percentage would be worse.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Peter Pollen</span> and I dined with the Admiral. After dinner, we discussed
         <span class="person">Fox-Ferdinand's</span> little tricks. The Admiral had heard a lot about <span class="person">his</span>
         flirtations with the <span class="person">Duke of Mecklenburg</span> lately sent from <span class="location">Berlin</span> on some
         sort of an ambassadorial mission to the Balkans. I told him of my visit
         to <span class="location">Sofia</span> during the interval which took place between <span class="person">Prince Ferdinand</span>
         proclaiming himself Tsar, and the tardy and unenthusiastic recognition
         of <span class="person">his</span> new rank by <span class="location">Great Britain.</span> <span class="person">Ferdinand's</span> Court Chamberlain asked me
         to dine. I wanted to refuse as I had meant to go on to <span class="location">Constantinople</span>,
         but Sir George <span class="person">Buchanan</span>, our Minister, begged me to accept. Diplomatic
         relations were broken off; <span class="person">he</span> had not seen <span class="person">Ferdinand</span> for a month: <span class="person">he</span>
         wanted to know what that <span class="person">Prince</span> would say to me: " but ," <span class="person">he</span> added, "you
         must on no account go in uniform. Seeing you are on the Army Council it
         would almost amount to a recognition of <span class="person">his</span> Kingship if you went there
         in uniform." I thought this a little far-fetched; however, I wrote back
         and said that I had the honour to accept, but that, as I was travelling,
         I had only my  kleine Uniform ; i.e., undress kit, handy. I proposed,
         therefore, with permission to take the liberty of presenting myself in
         evening dress, wearing miniature medals and decorations and the ribbon
         of the Grand Cross of the Bath. By return messenger an answer came back,
         "<span class="person">His Majesty</span> particularly wished once more to see the admirable <span class="location">British</span>
         uniform:" would I come in  kleine Uniform ; meanwhile, to put me quite
         at my ease, H.M. had commanded the Court also to wear undress. I showed
         this to <span class="person">Sir George</span>, who laughed and said, "<span class="person">He</span> is too sharp; <span class="person">he</span> has done
         us; you must go now--there is no help for it." So I went in my grubby
         blue serge and found <span class="person">Ferdinand</span> and the whole of <span class="person">his</span> Court blazing with
         orders in the fullest of full dress!</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 25th September, 1915.  To <span class="location">Anzac</span> in the <span class="location"> Arno </span>. <span class="person">Birdie</span> met me and we
         walked along the lower part of the left of the <span class="location">Australia</span> trenches until
         we reached the <span class="location">New Zealanders</span> and were joined by <span class="person">Godley</span>. Lunched with
         <span class="person">General Inglefield;</span> then plodded through the trenches held by <span class="person">his</span>
         Division (the <span class="unit">54th</span>; nice-looking boys) and by the <span class="location">Indian</span> Brigade. On the
         left of the <span class="location">Indian</span> Brigade I was met by <span class="person">Peyton</span> who did pilot to me
         through the Scottish Horse section. The Bard joined us here and was in
         great form, full of administrative good works as in <span class="location">South Africa</span>. The
         Scottish Horse are as keen as schoolboys out for their first shoot. They
         were very proud of themselves and of the effect their rifles with
         telescopic sights had produced when put into the hands of gillies and
         deer stalkers, and at every twenty yards or so there was a Scottish
         Horseman looking along his sights, finger on trigger, and by his side a
         spotter whose periscope was fixed on the opposite loophole. The moment a
         <span class="location">Turkish</span> shadow darkened the loophole the word was given, the bullet
         sped. Not a very big mark a loophole at over 100 yards but they got it,
         they said, one try out of three.</p>
      
      
      <p>At the end of the Scottish Horse we came to the Worcester Yeomanry
         trench. But time was up[12] and I had to make tracks for <span class="location">Anzac</span> where we
         had tea with <span class="person">Birdie</span>, who had stuck to us throughout the tour. <span class="location">Imbros</span> by
         dinner-time. The quietest day, bar none, we have had on the <span class="location">Peninsula</span>
         since we first landed. Not a shot was fired anywhere except by our own
         snipers.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 26th September, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  Last night, after dinner, <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>
         came across with a black piece of news in <span class="person">his</span> pocket:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"(No. 8229, cipher). From <span class="person">Earl Kitchener</span> to General Sir <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span>. On
         account of the mobilization of the Bulgarian Army <span class="location">Greece</span> has asked the
         Allies to send a force to <span class="location">Salonika</span> in order to enable her to support
         <span class="location">Serbia</span> should the latter be attacked by <span class="location">Bulgaria</span>, as well as by German
         forces from the North. No doubt you realize that if by such action
         <span class="location">Bulgaria</span> joins hands with the Central Powers they will have a clear road
         to <span class="location">Constantinople</span> and <span class="location">Gallipoli</span>, and be able to send large quantities
         of ammunition or troops, rendering your position very hazardous.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Both <span class="location">France</span> and ourselves have promised to send between us the troops
         asked for, viz., 150,000 men, and urgency is essential. It is evident
         that under these circumstances some troops will have to be taken from
         the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> to go to <span class="location">Salonika</span>, but it must be clearly understood
         that there is no intention of withdrawing from the <span class="location">Peninsula</span> or of
         giving up the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> operations until the Turks are defeated. Your
         taff officer has suggested to me that you saw no difficulty in reducing
         the length of your line and concentrating your forces by withdrawing
         from the position now held around <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay to the neighbourhood of the
         Kaiajik Aghala position whence a line might be drawn to the sea.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Before the situation was changed by the <span class="location">Bulgarians'</span> action we
         considered that, owing to the marshy nature of the country now occupied
         at <span class="location">Suvla</span> and the approaching winter, this reduction of front would be
         strategically advantageous. Hence my telegram No. 8162 to which your No.
         M.F. 664 replies.</p>
      
      
      <p>"An offensive along practically the whole line in <span class="location">France</span> has now
         commenced. The infantry are attacking to-day. Far-reaching results are
         anticipated which, if secured, should greatly affect your situation.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The projected dispatch of reinforcements of French and <span class="location">British</span>
         divisions for Asiatic operations must be in abeyance until a decision
         in the Western theatre can be reached. The troops now at the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>
         which are required for <span class="location">Salonika</span> would be two divisions, preferably the
         <span class="unit">Xth</span> and <span class="unit">XIth</span>. The French would also have to withdraw either a brigade or
         a division from their force at <span class="location">Helles</span> for the same purpose. The Yeomanry
         now  en route  to you would also have to be diverted to <span class="location">Salonika</span> and we
         should have to arrange to mount them from <span class="location">Egypt</span> after their arrival.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Cable me at once your ideas as to meeting these requirements. The
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> Committee consider a withdrawal from <span class="location">Suvla</span> to be advisable
         under the circumstances, but they had not seen your telegram No. 664. We
         have been asked to send the 15-inch howitzer, now on board ship at
         <span class="location">Mudros</span>, to <span class="location">Belgrade</span> as soon as possible."</p>
      
      
      <p>Amen--so be it! Our mighty stroke at the vitals of the enemy is to break
         itself to pieces against the Balkans. God save the King! May the Devil
         fly away with the whole of the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> Committee!!</p>
      
      
      <p>What arguments--what pressure--I wonder can have moved <span class="person">Lord K.</span> to swap horse
         in mid-<span class="location">Dardanelles</span>? In December <span class="person">Lord K.</span> as good as told me <span class="person">I</span> was "for it" if
         the day should come along for <span class="person">his</span> New Army to help the <span class="location">Serbians.</span> G.H.Q.
         in <span class="location">France</span> had belittled <span class="person">his</span> effort to create it; they had tried to throw
         cold water on it (the New Army) and now we should see how they liked it
         going to <span class="location">Salonika</span>! The reason why <span class="person">Lord K.</span>, at that time, turned the project
         down was <span class="person">his</span> view that one Army Corps was too small a force to launch
         into those regions of great armies and that, if the <span class="location">Germans</span> turned
         seriously in that direction, it would be gobbled up. But two Army Corps
         would starve, seeing we had no pack transport and that the railway would
         only feed 40,000 men. Nor had we any mountain guns. In February <span class="person">he</span>
         resurrected the question but that time <span class="person">he</span> was put off by the typhus.
         "Whatever destroys my New Army," he said, "it shall not be the <span class="location">Serbian</span>
         lice." Now he cables as if <span class="person">he</span> was being quite consistent and sensible,
         now , when in every aspect, the odds have turned against the
         undertaking. As to the <span class="location">Bulgarians</span> having "a clear road to <span class="location">Constantinople</span>
         and <span class="location">Gallipoli</span>" my memorable dinner with <span class="person">Ferdinand</span>, and <span class="person">his</span> insistence on
         <span class="person">his</span> "pivotal" position, makes me perfectly certain that the bones of no
         <span class="location">Bulgarian</span> grenadier will fertilize the <span class="location">Peninsula</span>--whatever happens. And
         if the inconceivable were conceivable and <span class="person">Ferdinand</span> were to work for
         anything but <span class="person">his</span> own immediate gain--there is no room for them here!
         That fact is cast iron. The <span class="location">Turkish Empire</span> is  here  in full force.
         <span class="person">Enver</span> can't feed more! These numbers cause us no alarm. Since the last
         abortive effort of the <span class="location">Turkish</span> Command to get their men to attack every
         soldier in the trenches knows well that the enemy are afraid of us. They
         dare not attack, they will not attack, and they cannot attack. We know
         that quite well. If <span class="person">Lord K.</span> would only come out here <span class="person">he</span> would realize that
         the Turk has lost his sting. I don't mean to say <span class="person">he</span> is not still a
         formidable fellow to turn out of <span class="person">his</span> trench, but <span class="person">he</span> can't attack any
         more: and that is just the moment we have chosen to sit down and do
         nothing; now, when the enemy has been brought to a standstill!</p>
      
      
      <p>During my absence <span class="person">Bailloud</span> has wired saying <span class="person">he</span> had received orders from
         <span class="person">his</span> own Minister of War to arrange for sending away one Division of the
         C.E.O. and <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> has cabled the startling news to our S. of S. for
         War.</p>
      
      
      <p>Well, well. If the Greeks and ourselves are going to push through the
         mountains to help the Serbs to hold <span class="location">Belgrade</span> and the line of the Danube,
         why then, no doubt, we are embarking upon something that would be fine
         were it feasible--something more hopeful than sitting at <span class="location">Salonika</span> and in
         its salubrious suburbs, the "political" advantages of which were
         preached to us by <span class="person">Napier</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>But let no man hereafter talk of <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> adventures.  Mon Dieu! </p>
      
      
      <p>Once again see the dupes of maps preparing to dash out their brains, or
         rather the brains of others, against the rocks. If only <span class="person">Joffre</span> and <span class="person">Lord K.</span>
         had looked at <span class="location">Belgrade</span> over the guns of an <span class="location">Austrian</span> Battery in <span class="location">Semlin</span>,
         as I did in 1909! The line of the Danube is untenable except by a very
         large force against the very large forces that can, and will, be brought
         against it and there is no Fleet there to feed a large force. Also, the
         communications of such a defending force will not only be mechanically
         rotten but will also be strategically at the tender mercy of the most
         cunning Prince in Europe. We may think we have squared <span class="person">Ferdinand</span>. But it
         is easier to square the circle than square a fox.</p>
      
      
      <p>On the Danube, the Central Powers can put  and keep  six men to our one,
         unless  we control the river from its mouth to <span class="location">Belgrade</span>. This we can
         only do by forcing the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>After outlining an answer for <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> to draft, I started off at
         10.45 for Anzac and <span class="location">Suvla</span>. With me were <span class="person">Taylor</span>, <span class="person">Gascoigne</span>, <span class="person">Lieutenant
            Moore</span> and <span class="person">Freddie</span>. From Anzac I walked along the old communication
         trench for a couple of miles, and then went round General <span class="person">Taylor</span>'s
         Brigade along the front by <span class="location">Green Hill</span> and the <span class="location">Chocolate Hills</span>. The heat
         was very exhausting.</p>
      
      
      <p>Yesterday's calm has proved to be the prelude to an attempted storm. At
         5 a.m. there was a big bombardment of the front line trenches, and the
         Turks made a gesture of defiance. The gesture did not go beyond fixing
         bayonets and shouting "Allah!" and the only result has been to render
         <span class="location">Suvla</span> more convinced than ever that the Turks are absolutely fed up.</p>
      
      
      <p>After invigorating myself with a good draught of regimental spirit, set
         forth to walk back to Anzac. Half way I halted at the <span class="location">Indian</span> Brigade
         Headquarters, and, on the invitation of the hospitable <span class="person">Colonel Palin</span>,
         had a square meal. Met <span class="person">Allanson</span>, the brave commander of the <span class="unit">6th Gurkhas</span>;
         <span class="person">Allanson</span> who scaled the heights of <span class="location">Sari Bair</span> and entered for a few
         hectic hours into the promised land. Oh, what a wonderful adventure <span class="person">his</span>
         has been! To have seen the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> and their defences lying flat at
         <span class="person">his</span> feet! To feel--as <span class="person">he</span> says <span class="person">he</span> did--that <span class="person">he</span> held the whole <span class="location">Turkish</span>
         Army by the throat!</p>
      
      
      <p>To-day's inspection has once more brought me into personal touch with
         the perfect confidence felt both at <span class="location">Anzac</span> and <span class="location">Suvla</span> in the
         demoralization of the Turks. This has nerved me to cable agreeing to
         spare the <span class="unit">10th</span> and <span class="unit">53rd Division</span> Divisions from <span class="location">Suvla</span> as well as a Brigade of
         French from <span class="location">Helles</span> and four and a half Brigades of <span class="location">British</span> Field
         Artillery:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F. 675). From General Sir <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span> to Secretary of State for
         War. Reference your No. 8229. Let me begin by saying that I quite
         realize that, to you, playing for your large stakes, the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>
         operation may temporarily become of a secondary nature. In spite of the
         <span class="location">Salonika</span> scheme I am, however, particular to note that it is not
         intended to withdraw from the <span class="location">Gallipoli</span> Peninsula, nor to give up here
         until the Turks are beaten. Bearing this in mind it becomes my duty to
         point out the objection to the abandonment of <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay, the
         consequences of which at this stage would, I consider, be so grave that
         I am warranted in running much risk to get you your two divisions by
         other means. The situation has greatly changed since I first suggested
         the possibility of abandoning the Bay, and its abandonment at this stage
         would, I feel convinced, enormously accentuate the difficulties of any
         subsequent attempt to capture the Narrows; unless, as a result of our
         landing troops at <span class="location">Salonika</span>, <span class="location">Bulgaria</span> were induced to side with us and
         not against us. Even when I told you in my No. M.F. 578 of 23rd August
         that the diminution of my forces might compel me to contract my line, I
         could not view the project without misgiving, in spite of the fact
         that, at that time, I had landed few reinforcements and little artillery
         in the new zone, and my views are not rightly interpreted when it is
         said that I saw no great difficulty in the enterprise. After I had
         received the reassuring news of reinforcements I sent you my No. M.F.
         589 of 26th August and I have from that date been pouring in large
         quantities of reinforcements and supplies in anticipation of winter, and
         have landed a large additional amount of artillery. Therefore, I could
         not hurriedly evacuate the Bay without sacrificing the majority of
         supplies and warlike stores. I might also have very considerable losses,
         for the Turks, who were previously 700 yards away, are now within
         bombing distance in places. They have a large number of guns in the
         northern zone and a retirement could only be effected under heavy fire,
         which with unseasoned troops would make the retreat a hazardous one. As
         explained in my No. M.F. 664 evacuation of the Bay would involve with it
         the  eventual  evacuation of all but the original <span class="location">Anzac</span> position. But
         even if this last step were not necessary the withdrawal of <span class="location">British</span>
         soldiers from <span class="location">Suvla</span> would be an overwhelming victory for the Turks. Our
         position in the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> would be entirely altered for the worse and
         even the effect of our landing of troops at <span class="location">Salonika</span> might be discounted
         in <span class="location">Bulgarian</span> eyes. At the present moment the <span class="location">Turkish</span> commissariat
         difficulties and tales of starving families which the wounded bring back
         from <span class="location">Constantinople</span> are having a bad effect on their  moral  and the
         number of desertions is on the increase. Two <span class="location">Turkish</span> attempts at the
         offensive have broken down completely during the last week as their
         troops refused to leave cover. If I give ground the <span class="location">Turkish</span>  moral  will
         immediately recover and instead of containing over 60,000 Turks in the
         Northern Zone there would be large numbers set free to go elsewhere. All
         these arguments seem to prove plainly that to evacuate a yard of <span class="location">Suvla</span>
         would be a most serious, and might prove a disastrous step. I would
         therefore prefer to run the risk of holding the line defensively with
         fewer troops in order to spare two divisions for the new enterprise.</p>
      
      
      <p>"I have at present one division in Corps Reserve at <span class="location">Suvla</span> and the <span class="unit">1st
            Australian Division</span> resting at <span class="location">Mudros</span> and also one brigade resting at
         <span class="location">Imbros</span>. By bringing the tired <span class="location">Australians</span> back and making them replace
         the Mounted Division in the section north of Susak Kuyu I could spare
         <span class="unit">Xth</span> and <span class="unit">LIIIth</span> Divisions or else <span class="unit">Xth</span> and <span class="unit">XIth.</span> I could also spare one
         French brigade from Cape <span class="location">Helles</span> without replacing it by troops from
         <span class="location">Suvla</span>, and a total of 4-1/2 <span class="location">British</span> Field Artillery brigades. This would
         at any rate enable me to postpone any evacuation at <span class="location">Suvla</span> and if the
         withdrawal became necessary later on there would be less loss involved
         in supplies and stores, as I could gradually make necessary preparations
         for this deplorable contingency.</p>
      
      
      <p>"The 15-inch howitzer is at <span class="location">Alexandria</span> and can be sent whenever you
         desire on the receipt of instructions. To-morrow I am having a
         conference here with the Corps Commanders concerned to consider the
         details. I hope that you realize that though the IXth Corps consists of
         <span class="unit">Xth</span>, <span class="unit">XIth</span> and <span class="unit">XIIIth</span> Divisions there are attached to it <span class="unit">LIIIrd Welsh
            Division</span>, Mounted Division and <span class="unit">XXIXth</span> Division, and I therefore
         sincerely trust you will not contemplate the withdrawal of the Corps
         Staff and Corps Commander to accompany the two divisions destined for
         <span class="location">Salonika</span>, for I have absolutely no one to replace them."</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 27th September, 1915.  After breakfast a dove, the <span class="location">German</span> sort, flew
         across from <span class="location">Chanak</span> and dropped four bombs on our Headquarters; all wide;
         no damage. At 11 o'clock <span class="person">Birdwood</span> and <span class="person">Byng</span> came over for a confab on the
         last upset. Both Generals went word by word through my M.F. 657 of the
         26th September,--(1) as to drawing in our horns at <span class="location">Suvla</span>,--(2) as to our
         power of holding on after we lose the <span class="unit">10th</span> and <span class="unit">53rd Division</span> Divisions. They
         concur in my cables and are emphatic as to the futility of making a gift
         of ground to any enemy who are shaking in their shoes. What the Turks
         want is a gift, not of ground but of high explosive shell. A few
         thousand pounds worth of that and <span class="person">Byng</span> would go ahead and settle their
         hash for good. <span class="person">Birdie</span> stayed to lunch during which meal I got a message
         from <span class="person">Bailloud</span> telling me flat that <span class="person">he</span> had orders from <span class="person">his</span> Government to
         get one Division over to <span class="location">Mudros</span> forthwith. As long as I am in command no
         soldier but myself shall handle the troops entrusted to me. I have sent
         the following reply:--"Sorry that as my orders already telegraphed to
         you this morning are specific, I cannot permit any movement of troops
         away from the Peninsula pending further instructions."</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Ross</span> and <span class="person">Nevinson</span> (Press Correspondents), who have been away on a jaunt,
         called on me and had tea. <span class="person">Lord William Percy</span> and <span class="person">Sir Walter Barttelot</span>
         dined.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 28th September, 1915.  Office. At midnight an enemy aeroplane let us
         have a taste of <span class="person">his</span> high explosive--no harm done. At 10.30 this morning
         another came over and dropped a couple of bombs into the aerodrome close
         by--two men hit.</p>
      
      
      <p>Colonel <span class="person">Dorling</span> reported himself to me as Senior Paymaster.</p>
      
      
      <p>A cable from <span class="person">Lord K.</span> saying <span class="person">he</span> is glad to meet me as to holding on at <span class="location">Suvla</span>.
         <span class="person">He</span> agrees in fact that to draw in our horns would merely set free six
         <span class="location">Turkish</span> Divisions to attack us elsewhere. <span class="person">He</span> agrees also with my choice
         of Divisions for <span class="location">Salonika</span>. <span class="person">Lord K.</span> seems astonished at the behaviour of the
         French Government in sending tactical orders direct to <span class="person">Bailloud</span>. Most
         extraordinary, <span class="person">he</span> calls it. <span class="person">He</span> wants <span class="person">Byng</span> to go to <span class="location">Salonika</span> and winds up
         gloriously by telling me of the great things they are doing in <span class="location">France</span>;
         that, up to the present, 23,000 prisoners and over 40 guns have been
         taken, and that <span class="person">he</span> hopes there are more of each to follow. This fine
         success, <span class="person">he</span> says, should help us along in the East. So it should. I have
         cabled the good news across and ordered a  feu de joie  to be fired
         everywhere on the Peninsula in honour of the victory. The ball was
         opened at <span class="location">Helles</span> at 7 p.m., the Turks replied vigorously with every gun
         and rifle they could bring to bear, and rarely, I imagine, has a
         "furious joy" expressed itself more furiously.</p>
      
      
      <p>Nowhere in the Empire has this fine victory brought more heartfelt
         relief and joy than at the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>: to have been brought to a
         standstill, for the third time of asking, for  nothing ; that was the
         fear which had haunted us.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 29th September, 1915.  Work. At 11 a.m. tore myself away from my papers
         to play principal part in a gay little ceremony. Outside my office a
         guard of honour of Surrey Yeomanry, Naval Division and <span class="location">Australians</span>
         formed three sides of a square. <span class="person">Bertier</span>, de <span class="person">la Borde</span> and <span class="person">Pelliot</span> were
         led in smiling like brides going up to the altar, and, after a tiny
         speech, I decorated the first with the D.S.O. and the other two with the
         Military Cross. All three Officers are most popular, and there were loud
         cheers. De <span class="person">la Borde</span> had tea and <span class="person">Mitchell</span> came in at the same time to say
         good-bye. We are all distressed at losing <span class="person">Mitchell</span>. <span class="person">He</span> is a very fine
         specimen of the sailor of the modern school. Efficient, modest, untiring
         at <span class="person">his</span> work. <span class="person">He</span> has collaborated in the most loyal and devoted manner
         with the G.S., and I don't know how we should ever have got on without
         him.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Nevinson</span>, the Correspondent, came again with <span class="person">Maxwell</span>, the Press Censor.
         <span class="person">Nevinson</span> wants to find out whether it would be worth <span class="person">his</span> while to go to
         <span class="location">Salonika</span>. I would like to lend him a hand for <span class="person">he</span> is such a nice fellow,
         but the matter is about as secret as can be, and I don't feel myself
         free to say much. The Captains of H.M.S. <span class="location"> Cornwall </span> and <span class="location"> Cornwallis </span>
         dined; also <span class="person">Flight Commander Samson</span> and <span class="person">Ward</span>, King's Messenger. The last
         named starts to-morrow night and carried off with him my letter to <span class="person">Lord K.</span>
         Amongst other things I write:--"In the cables which have passed between
         us, I have found it anything but an easy business to strike the happy
         mean between executing <span class="person">your</span> wishes promptly and cheerfully on the one
         hand, and, on the other, giving <span class="person">you</span> a faithful impression of how we
         should stand here once <span class="person">your</span> orders had been carried out.</p>
      
      
      <p>"If I make too little of the dangers which surround me, then you may be
         encouraged to weaken me still further, thereby jeopardizing the whole of
         this enterprise. But if I allow my anxieties to get too much the upper
         hand, why then I may be ruining some larger enterprise, the bearing of
         which I have no means of gauging."</p>
      
      
      <p>I then explain the situation and wind up:--"In the small hours of the
         morning, before I have had my matutinal cup of tea, the immediate
         outlook gives me a feeling of cold feet in a more aggravated form than I
         have hitherto experienced. The whole plan of the French Asiatic
         subsidiary operation has gone, for the meantime, by the board. <span class="location">England</span>
         and <span class="location">France</span> between them cannot find men enough, I should think, to send
         considerable forces to Asia as well as run an entirely new show
         elsewhere. Indeed, Naval requirements alone would seem entirely to
         forbid it. But I must not worry you any more with surmises. After all,
         nothing great in this world was ever easily accomplished. Never has
         there been such an example of that as in the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> Expedition. How
         many times has success seemed to be on the point of crowning our
         efforts, and yet, on each occasion, just as we are beginning to see
         light through the tangle of obstacles, preparing for an assault, or
         whatever it may be, something occurs to upset the apple-cart. None the
         less we do advance, and we will succeed in the end. I feel I am playing
         it rather low down inflicting on you the outline of my own trouble at a
         moment when your own must be infinitely greater.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Reading over this letter which I have not now time to re-write or
         correct, it strikes me that in concentrating my mind purely on the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> I may have given a wrong impression of my general attitude
         towards your latest demand. No one can realize, I believe, more clearly
         than I do that the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> operations themselves hinge for their
         success to a very large extent upon the maintenance of a barrier between
         the Central Powers and <span class="location">Constantinople</span>. As far as reinforcements of men
         to the enemy in the field are concerned, such inter-communication would
         not be so fatal as might perhaps be imagined. The <span class="location">Gallipoli</span> Peninsula is
         a limited area, and if the <span class="location">&gt;Germans</span> had a million men at <span class="location">Constantinople</span>
         they could not, under present conditions, add many, if any, to the
         numbers already opposed to us. But the free transit of coal, flour,
         ammunition and big guns might well put us all in the cart--the cart
         being in this instance, the sea."</p>
      
      
      <p>My A.D.C. has brought me an irritated message from the A.G., War
         Office:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"<span class="person">Your</span> No. M.F.A. 4003 of the 24th instant. Are <span class="person">you</span> aware that <span class="person">your</span>
         telegram was really a demand for 60,000 men with a weekly supply in
         addition. We do not see how to meet such large numbers in view of the
         present situation in <span class="location">France</span>. Have the numbers at Base, <span class="location">Alexandria</span>, and
         men returning from hospital, etc., been taken into account? Please state
         what are <span class="person">your</span> minimum requirements to carry on with."</p>
      
      
      <p>Am I aware, etc.? Why certainly;  and so is the A.G.  To ignore facts is
         one thing; to be ignorant of them is another. These facts are, or should
         be, the daily bread of his Department. I resent this surprise; it is not
         genuine. If, as the A.G. says, they have not got the men to send, why in
         God's name do they go on telling the people they  have  got them?</p>
      
      
      <p>Have drafted out this answer:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"A.G. My telegram No. M.F.A. 4003 told you the number required to bring
         and keep all formations up to establishment and, as an estimate, the
         numbers given therein are accurate. There is nothing new in that
         telegram; it is only the culmination of many demands, the deficiency,
         which was serious enough before, being aggravated by the prevailing
         epidemic. I took into account the numbers in Base depots and men
         returning from hospital. I certainly hope that there may be a decrease
         in the sick rate and that there will be an increase in the numbers
         returning from hospital, but that cannot make any difference to my
         present shortage of establishment though it would affect the strength of
         monthly drafts required.</p>
      
      
      <p>"I would like further to point out that only 750 of the 20,000 drafts
         now coming are for the Territorial Force, the remainder being for the
         Regulars. Hence assuming that wastage will be equally distributed over
         all the eight divisions, the estimated shortage of 30,490 on 9th October
         will be constituted as follows:--Four Territorial Force divisions,
         26,583; four Regular divisions, 3,907.</p>
      
      
      <p>"When my No. M.F.A. 4003 was sent no question had arisen of denuding my
         force for a fresh expedition elsewhere. I fully realize that you cannot
         send what does not exist and I will do the best possible with what you,
         knowing my situation, are able to send; but I do not consider that it is
         possible to view my position in winter with any equanimity unless I am
         to receive substantial drafts and unless a normal flow of reinforcements
         for all divisions can be arranged so as to counter the difficulties that
         are inherent in keeping a force operating so far from <span class="location">England</span> up to
         establishment."</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 30th September, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  Peace on the Peninsula; trouble at
         G.H.Q. The <span class="unit">10th Division</span> is taking its departure from <span class="location">Suvla</span> undisturbed
         by the enemy. Not a shot is being fired. Some say this denotes
         extraordinary skill in the conduct of the withdrawal; others,
         extraordinary delight on the part of the Turks to see them clearing
         out. I don't believe in either theory. The Turks have been fought to a
         standstill and there is no attack left in them--not under  any 
         circumstances or temptation; that is what I believe in my heart,
         otherwise I would refuse point blank to strip myself of two full
         divisions under their noses. Still, it is nervous work presuming to this
         extent upon their fatigue and I will not agree to the <span class="unit">53rd Division</span> going too, as
         the loss of three Divisions would leave an actual hole in our line.
         Meanwhile, it is a relief to hear that the move is going on just like
         peacetime. As to G.H.Q., all is held up by uncertainty. Our whole
         enterprise hangs still in the balance. No date for the sailing of our
         troops for <span class="location">Salonika</span> can yet be fixed, and we may get them back. Am glued
         to the cable terminus waiting, waiting, waiting. I have agreed to let
         the 2nd Brigade of the French go!</p>
      
      
      <p>This cable sent to-day to <span class="person">Lord K.</span> explains itself:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"The following has just been received from <span class="person">Bailloud</span>:--'I have the honour
         to inform you that I have received a telegram from the French Minister
         of War ordering me (1) to embark one division of the Corps
         Expéditionnaire immediately for <span class="location">Salonika</span>; (2) to organize this division,
         which will be placed under my command, into two brigades of Metropolitan
         Infantry with two groups of 75 mm., one group of mountain artillery, one
         battery of 125 mm. howitzer and four 120 mm. guns. I am taking steps to
         execute this order and to hold the present section of the French line
         with the force remaining in the Peninsula, which will be placed under
         General Brulard.'</p>
      
      
      <p>"I said in my telegram No. M.F. 675, that I could only spare one brigade
         of the <span class="location">French.</span> I desire to place on record that if this order of the
         <span class="location">French Government</span> is carried out the <span class="unit">LIIIrd Division</span> cannot possibly be
         spared without seriously endangering the safety of this force and the
         whole future of the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> enterprise. Even if I were to keep the
         <span class="unit">LIIIrd Division</span> it would not relieve me of intense anxiety. The fact
         will not escape your notice that the division to go is being
         re-constructed so that nothing but European troops are included, thus
         leaving an undue proportion of Senegalese. This constitutes such a grave
         danger that, if I had the power, I would refuse to allow <span class="person">Bailloud</span> to
         carry out this order of <span class="person">his</span> Government. It need hardly be pointed out
         that all your hopes of success in the Balkans would be upset by a
         disaster at Cape <span class="location">Helles</span>. Even when I said that I could spare one French
         Infantry Brigade the Commander of the VIIIth Corps, who is one of the
         last men in the Army to express alarmist views, represented to me, in
         view of the physical condition of a large proportion of <span class="person">his</span> troops, the
         gravity of the case in the strongest terms."</p>
      
      
      <p>A reminder of mine  re  the Ashmead-Bartlett incident has drawn an
         amusing and highly unexpected answer from the War Office:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"<span class="person">Murdoch</span> was found to be carrying a despatch for the Prime Minister
         criticizing military operations in <span class="location">Gallipoli</span>. <span class="person">He</span> carried nothing for
         Lawson."</p>
      
      
      <p>I could not help laughing heartily at the blue looks of <span class="person">Tyrrell</span>, the
         Head of our Intelligence. After all, this is <span class="person">Asquith's</span> own affair. I do
         not for one moment believe <span class="person">Mr.Asquith</span> would employ such agencies and
         for sure <span class="person">he</span> will turn <span class="person">Murdoch</span> and <span class="person">his</span> wares into the wastepaper basket.
         I have reassured <span class="person">Tyrrell</span>. Tittle-tattle will effect no lodgment in the
         <span class="person">Asquithian</span> brain.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Lieutenant Moore</span> from the Military Secretary's office in <span class="location">London</span> dined.
         <span class="person">He</span> has been useful to us. During the night there was rain and heavy fog.
         The evacuation of <span class="location">Suvla</span> by the <span class="unit">10th</span> Division goes on without the
         smallest hitch and is almost finished--all except the guns. Whether the
         Turks have fallen asleep or only closed an eye is the question of the
         hour but <span class="person">Birdwood's</span> Intelligence are certain they are stone cold and
         cannot be dragged to the attack.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 1st October, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  S. of S. cables he will not overlook <span class="person">our</span>
         wants in the matter of ammunition but that "at the present moment all he
         can get has to be sent to <span class="location">France</span>." I have thanked him. Not a word from
         <span class="location">France</span> since we fired the  feu de joie .</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Lord K.</span> believes in the East and sends shell to the West. The reason is that
         <span class="person">Lord K.</span>'s  beliefs  are only intuitions; <span class="person">he</span> believes in the same sort of way
         that <span class="person">Elijah</span> knew certain things.</p>
      
      
      <p>The principle underlying the world war seems to me this:--that wherever
         the new system of trenches, dug-outs, barbed wire, can reach its fullest
         development,  there  we should prefer the defensive. Wherever this new
         system cannot be fully developed, there the old ideas hold good and
         there are the theatres for the offensive. In <span class="location">France</span> and <span class="location">Flanders</span> where
         both sides are within a few hours' run, on good railways, from their own
         chief arsenals and depôts the new system attains prodigious power. In
         the <span class="location">Turkish Empire</span> almost all the conditions; railways, material,
         factories, etc., are favourable to the old and unfavourable to the new
         conditions.</p>
      
      
      <p>To me these views appear as clear as crystal and as unanswerable as
         Euclid. The tenacity of the new system of defence; the pressure of
         <span class="location">France</span>; the apathy of a starved military opinion; the fact that all our
         most powerful soldiers are up to their necks in the West, combine to
         keep us ramming our heads against the big pile of barbed wire instead of
         getting through by the gate called strait.</p>
      
      
      <p>Next <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> with the following electrical bombshell:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"By <span class="person">Bailloud</span>'s report I see that <span class="person">he</span> considers that the French line can
         be held by one division. If, on reconsideration, you agree with this
         view can you spare the <span class="unit">LIIIth</span> Division?"</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Lord K.</span> has pounced like a hawk on <span class="person">Bailloud</span>'s statement (which I cabled to
         him yesterday) that <span class="person">he</span> is taking steps for Brulard to hold the French
         section with one division.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have answered:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F. 703). From General Sir <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span> to <span class="person">Earl Kitchener</span>. Your
         No. 8409, cipher. Not one word of my No. M.F. 693 can I take back. The
         situation at Cape <span class="location">Helles</span> cannot be fully realized. May I remind you that
         when on 20th August I moved the <span class="unit">XXIXth</span> Division to <span class="location">Suvla</span>, I left at Cape
         <span class="location">Helles</span> only the minimum garrison compatible with safety. Since that date
         the total <span class="location">British</span> troops there have decreased in strength from 15,300 to
         13,300 rifles, and now I am losing a French composite division which is
         made up of the only troops of the Corps Expéditionnaire on whom I can
         rely, as well as 44 guns. It is my considered opinion that to leave
         protection of Cape <span class="location">Helles</span> to one division of Colonial troops, plus
         13,300 worn-out <span class="location">British</span> Territorials and Naval Volunteers, is running
         too serious a risk. To-day, therefore, I am moving one brigade of <span class="unit">XXIXth</span>
         Division back from <span class="location">Suvla</span> to reinforce VIIIth Corps in order to have some
         regular troops there on whom I can rely. This makes it impossible to
         spare the <span class="unit">LIIIth</span> Division. The change of opinion on the part of
         <span class="person">Bailloud</span>, when <span class="person">he</span> gets away from a position which I have found it
         difficult to persuade <span class="person">him</span> to hold with two divisions, and which <span class="person">he</span> now,
         as <span class="person">you</span> say, thinks can be held with one division composed largely of
         blacks, is startling enough to need no comment. If you want to get at
         <span class="person">his</span> real opinion, suggest that <span class="person">he</span> stays here with one division while
         <span class="person">Brulard</span> goes to <span class="location">Salonika</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>"A despatch from <span class="person">Bailloud</span> has  just  reached me on the situation in
         French section after <span class="person">his</span> own departure with one division. It is as
         follows:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"'One division will then be defending our present line with an effective
         strength reduced by half, and with Infantry which comprises only
         Colonial contingents, half European and half native. I feel it to be my
         duty to expose the situation to you in order that you may be able to
         decide whether the time has not now arrived to reduce the present
         section of the C.E.O., making part of it occupied by <span class="location">British</span> troops and
         holding a solid reserve in rear of the Allies' first line capable of
         dealing with any situation.'</p>
      
      
      <p>"I believe this indicates <span class="person">Bailloud</span>'s real opinion; it is a curious
         contrast to that quoted in your No. 8409, cipher, dated 30th September."</p>
      
      
      <p>At 11.30 crossed to "K" and inspected the <span class="unit">87th Brigade</span> of the <span class="unit">29th</span>
         Division. <span class="person">Lucas</span>, of the <span class="unit">Berks Regiment</span>, commanded. Saw the Border
         Regiment under Colonel Pollard; then the renowned Royal Inniskilling
         Fusiliers under <span class="person">Major Pierce</span>, the full strength of the Battalion on
         parade "all present" was 220! Next the <span class="person">Lord K.</span>O.S.B.s; they were under the
         command of <span class="person">Major Stoney</span>; last the South Wales Borderers under the
         command of <span class="person">Captain Williams</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>The men were in rags and looked very tired. This is the first time in
         the campaign our rank and file have seemed sorry for themselves. Ten
         days of rest had been promised them and now they are being hurried back
         to the trenches before they have had a week. My heart goes out to them
         entirely. Were I they I would feel mad with me. The breaking of my word
         to the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> has to be shouldered by me just like all the other
         results of this new Balkan adventure; the withdrawal of the <span class="location">Irish</span> and
         the French for <span class="location">Salonika</span> leaves no margin of rest for what's left.</p>
      
      
      <p>Inspected also the West Riding Field Company of Royal Engineers under
         <span class="person">Major Bayley</span>, and the West Lancashire Field Ambulance.</p>
      
      
      <p>A long letter from <span class="person">Maxwell</span> putting <span class="person">his</span> point of view about the <span class="unit">51st</span> and
         <span class="unit">53rd Sikhs</span>. Were we both sealed-pattern Saints we'd be bound to fall
         foul of one another working under so perverse a system. <span class="person">He</span> has written
         me very nicely; nothing could be nicer. I have replied by return:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"Yours of 24th just received. As to the wires about the 51st and 53rd
         between myself and the War Office, and your remarks thereon, we stand so
         much on one platform, and are faced so much by the same difficulties,
         that I think it ought to be fairly easy for us to come to an
         understanding in most conceivable circumstances, as indeed our
         co-operation up to date has shown.</p>
      
      
      <p>"If <span class="location">Egypt</span> goes, then I shall not last very long. If I am wiped out, I
         think it will be the preface to trouble in <span class="location">Egypt</span>.[13]</p>
      
      
      <p>"As to myself I am 60,000 below strength. I had a cable from the War
         Office a day or two ago expressing naïve astonishment at this figure. I
         replied that the figure was accurate and that there was nothing new
         about it as it only denoted the accumulation of a state of things which
         had been continuously reported since the very first day when we started
         off from <span class="location">England</span> minus the ten per cent. margin of excess given to every
         unit going across to <span class="location">France</span>. This is the essential cause of our repeated
         failure to make that last little push which just differentiates partial
         from conclusive success. In every case this has been so. Had I been able
         to throw in my ten per cent. margin on the third day after landing,
         there is no doubt in the world we would have got right up on to <span class="location">Achi
            Baba.</span> Afterwards, each engagement we fought, although our total numbers
         may have been largely increased, the old formations were always at half
         strength or something less. However, I won't bother you about this as
         your time is too precious to enter into 'might-have-beens' and so is
         mine.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Meantime, my line is very, very thin, and the men are getting entirely
         worn out. In the midst of this I am called upon to send away two
         Divisions, the French and the <span class="location">Irish</span>, to ---- you know where. I have done
         so without a murmur, although it puts me into a ticklish position.
         Reinforcements are now to be diverted elsewhere and my command is not an
         enviable one. I quite understand the necessity of trying to maintain a
         barrier between <span class="location">Essen</span> and <span class="location">Constantinople</span>. I quite understand also the
         danger of doing so at the expense of this attenuated, exhausted force. I
         have represented the facts home, and it is for them to decide."</p>
      
      
      <p>Dined with the Admiral.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 2nd October, 1915.  The despatch of the <span class="location">Salonika</span> force and their outfit
         are absorbing all my energies. Our whole Expeditionary Force is being
         drawn upon to send the <span class="unit">10th Division</span> creditably turned out to the new
         theatre. The twenty-four hours' delay caused by the political crisis at
         <span class="location">Athens</span> has been a godsend in enabling me to reclothe and re-equip the
         detachment from top to toe. The supplies for my own force are now
         exhausted, but,--on the principle of the starving garrison who threw
         loaves over the ramparts at the besiegers, we must try and make a good
         first impression on the Greeks.</p>
      
      
      <p>The submarine catcher, or the "Silver Baby" as the men call it, has been
         flying about all day, without luck. <span class="person">Gascoigne</span> and <span class="person">Bertier</span> dined. Blazing
         hot; quite a setback to August temperatures.</p>

      <p>[Footnote 13: The last time this subject was broached between Lord
         Kitchener and myself was immediately after the evacuation of <span class="location">Helles</span>.
         Everyone was intensely relieved, especially <span class="person">Lord Kitchener</span>, for <span class="person">he</span> had
         realized better than our politicians the desperate stakes we had planked
         down in our gamble with the Clerk of the Weather. Yet in that very
         moment when the burden of an intolerable anxiety had just been lifted
         from <span class="person">his</span> shoulders <span class="person">he</span> took the occasion to declare to me that <span class="person">he</span> stood
         by every word <span class="person">he</span> had said. What <span class="person">he</span> "had said," was that any withdrawal
         from the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> must react in due course upon Islam, and especially
         upon <span class="location">Egypt</span>. Cairo, <span class="person">he</span> held to be the centre of the Mahomedan doctrine
         and the pivotal point of our great Mahomedan Imperium. An evacuation of
         the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> would serve as an object lesson to <span class="location">Egypt</span> just as our
         blunders in the <span class="location">Crimea</span> had served as a motive to the <span class="location">Indian</span> mutineers.
         Ultimate success was not the point in either case. The point was that
         the legend of the invincibility of <span class="location">British</span> troops should be shattered in
         some signal and quite unmistakable fashion. "The East," <span class="person">he</span> said, "moved
         slowly in the fifties, and it will move slowly now. We've had a
         wonderful delivery but--depend upon it--the price has yet to be
         paid!"--IAN H., 1920.]</p>

         </p>
      
      
      
      <p> 3rd October, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  Church Parade. Inspected escort, men of the
         <span class="unit">Howe</span> and <span class="unit">Nelson</span> Battalions and a contingent from the <span class="unit">12th Australian Infantry</span> and <span class="unit">26th
            Australian Infantry</span>. At 12.15 <span class="person">Bailloud</span>, <span class="person">Brulard</span> and <span class="person">Girodon</span> arrived from
         <span class="location">Mudros</span> for a last conference. Everything is fixed up. We are going to
         help the derelict division of French in every way we can. <span class="person">Bailloud</span>, for
         <span class="person">his</span> part, promises to leave them their fair share of guns and trench
         mortars. Whenever I see him I know <span class="person">he</span> is one of the best fellows in the
         world. We went down and waved farewells from the pier. <span class="person">He</span> was quite
         frank. <span class="person">He</span> does not think the Allies have either the vision or the heart
         to go through with <span class="location">Gallipoli</span>: <span class="person">he</span> begins to suspect that the big push on
         the Western Front is going to yield no laurels: so <span class="location">Salonika</span> hits <span class="person">his</span>
         fancy.</p>
      
      
      <p>Lieutenants Weston and Schemallach of the <span class="location">Australians</span> and Lieutenant
         Gellibrand of the Naval Division lunched. A <span class="person">Mr. Unsworth</span> came to talk
         over gifts for the <span class="location">Australia</span> troops. <span class="person">He</span> seems a capital chap; full of
         go and goodwill to all men.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 4th October, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  Vague warnings have taken shape in an
         event. A cable from <span class="person">Lord K.</span> telling me to decipher the next message myself. I
         have not drafted out an average of fifty telegrams a day for <span class="person">Lord K.</span> for
         six months at a stretch without knowing something of <span class="person">his</span>  modus
         scribendi . The Staff were pleasantly excited at the idea that some new
         move was in the wind. I knew the new move--or thought I did.</p>
      
      
      <p>Well, not that: not exactly that; not this time. But the enemies of our
         enterprise have got our range to a nicety and have chucked their first
         bomb bang into the middle of my camp.</p>
      
      
      <p>A "flow of unofficial reports from <span class="location">Gallipoli</span>," so <span class="person">Lord K.</span> cables to me, is
         pouring into the War Office. These "unofficial reports" are "in much the
         same strain" (perhaps they spring from the same source?). "They
         adversely criticize the work of the Headquarters Staff and complaints
         are made that its members are much out of touch with the troops. The War
         Office also doubt whether their present methods are quite satisfactory."
         <span class="person">Lord K.</span> therefore suggests "some important changes in your Headquarters
         Staff; for instance, if you agreed, Kiggell from home to take
         <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>'s place with you. Should you, however, decline and desire to
         remain as at present, may we assume that we are quite safe in regarding
         these unofficial reports as not representing the true feelings of the
         troops?"</p>
      
      
      <p>So----! On the face of it this cable seems to suggest that a man widely
         known as a straight and capable soldier should be given the shortest of
         shrifts at the instance of "unofficial reports"; i.e., camp gossip.
         Surely the cable message carries with it some deeper significance!</p>
      
      
      <p>I am grateful to old <span class="person">Lord K.</span> <span class="person">He</span> is trying to save me. <span class="person">He</span> picked out
         <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> himself. Not so long ago <span class="person">he</span> cabled me in <span class="person">his</span> eagerness to
         promote him to Major-General; <span class="person">he</span> would not suggest substituting the
         industrious Kiggell if he didn't fear for me and for the whole of this
         enterprise.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Lord K.</span> wants, so <span class="person">he</span> says, "some important change"; that cannot mean, surely,
         that <span class="person">he</span> wants a sufficiently showy scapegoat to feed the ravenous
         critics--or does it? Perhaps, <span class="person">he</span>'s got to gain time; breathing space
         wherein to resume the scheme which was sidetracked by the offensive in
         <span class="location">France</span> and smashed by the diversion to <span class="location">Salonika</span>. Given time, our scheme
         may yet be resumed. The Turks are in the depths. <span class="person">Sarrail</span> with <span class="person">his</span> six
         divisions behind him could open the Narrows in no time. I see the plan.
         <span class="person">Lord K.</span> must have a splendid sacrifice but by the Lord they shan't have the
         man who stood by me like a rock during those first ghastly ten days.</p>
      
      
      <p>The new C.R.E., <span class="person">General Williams</span>, and <span class="person">Ellison</span> turned up for lunch.
         <span class="person">Williams</span> gave us the first authentic news we have had about those Aden
         excursions and alarms.</p>
      
      
      <p>An amusing aftermath of the evacuation by the French and <span class="location">Irish</span>
         Divisions. When the last of <span class="person">Bailloud</span>'s troops had embarked the Turks
         dropped manifestoes from aeroplanes along the lines of the Senegalese
         calling upon these troops to make terms and come over now that their
         white comrades had left them to have their throats cut. I have cabled
         this queer item to the S. of S. Evidently the enemy were quite well
         aware of our withdrawal. Then  why  didn't they shell the beaches? At
         French Headquarters they believe that the Turks were so glad to see our
         backs that they hardly dared breathe (much less fire a shell) lest we
         should change our minds.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 5th October, 1915.  First thing another cable from <span class="person">Lord K.</span> saying, "<span class="person">I</span> think
         it well to let you know" that it is "quite understood by the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>
         Committee that you are adopting only a purely defensive attitude at
         present." Also:--"<span class="person">I</span> have no reason to imagine <span class="person">you</span> have any intention of
         taking the offensive anywhere along the line seeing <span class="person">I</span> have been unable
         to replace your sick and wounded men." But, if <span class="person">he</span> knows I  can't  take
         the offensive, why trouble to cable me that the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> Committee
         expect me to adopt "only a purely defensive attitude"? I realize where
         we stand; <span class="person">Lord K.</span>, <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> and I,--on the verge. We are getting on for
         two months now since the August fighting--all that time we have been
         allowed to do nothing--literally, allowed to do nothing, seeing we have
         been given no shell. What a fiasco! The <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> is not a sanatorium;
         <span class="location">Suvla</span> is not Southend. With the men we have lost from sickness in the
         past six weeks we could have beaten the Turks twice over. Now Government
         seem to be about to damn everything--themselves included.</p>
      
      
      <p>But after all, who am I to judge the Government of the <span class="location">British Empire</span>?
         What do I know of their difficulties, pledges, and enemies--whether
         outside or inside the fold?</p>
      
      
      <p>I have no grouse against Government or War Office--still less against
         <span class="person">Lord K.</span>--though many hundred times have I groused.[14]</p>
      
      
      <p>Freely and gratefully do I admit that the individuals have done their
         best. Most of all am I indebted--very deeply indebted--to <span class="person">Lord K.</span> for having
         refrained absolutely from interference with my plan of campaign or with
         the tactical execution thereof.</p>
      
      
      <p>But things are happening now which seem beyond belief. That the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> Committee should complacently send me a message to say we
         "quite understand that you are adopting only a purely defensive
         attitude at present" is staggering when put side by side with the carbon
         of this, the very last cable I have sent them. "I think you should know
         immediately that the numbers of sick evacuated in the IXth Corps during
         the first three days of October were 500 men on the 1st instant; 735 men
         on the 2nd instant and 607 men on the 3rd instant. Were this rate kept
         up it would come to 45 per cent. of our strength evacuated in one
         month."</p>
      
      
      <p>Three quarters of this sickness is due to inaction--and now the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> Committee "quite understand" I am "adopting only a purely
         defensive action at present." I have never adopted a defensive attitude.
         They have forced us to sit idle and go sick because--at the very last
         moment--they have permitted the French offensive to take precedence of
         ours, although, on the face of it, there was no violent urgency in
         <span class="location">France</span> as there is here. Our men in <span class="location">France</span> were remarkably healthy; they
         were not going sick by thousands. But I feel too sick myself--body and
         soul--to let my mind dwell on these miseries.</p>
      
      
      <p>Sealed my resolution (resignation?) by giving my answer about
         <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>. Though the sins of my General Staff have about as much to
         do with the real issues as the muddy water had to do with the death of
         the argumentative lamb, I begin by pointing out to the War Office wolf
         that "no Headquarters Staff has ever escaped similar criticism."</p>
      
      
      <p>Grumblings are an old campaigner's  vade mecum . Bred by inaction;
         enterprise and activity smother them. A sickness of the spirit, they
         are like the flies that fasten on those who stay too long in one place.
         Was <span class="person">Doughty Wylie</span> "much out of touch with the troops" when <span class="person">he</span> led the
         <span class="location">Dublins</span>, <span class="location">Munsters</span> and <span class="location">Hampshires</span> up from "V" beach and fell gloriously
         at their head? Was <span class="person">Williams</span> "out of touch" when <span class="person">he</span> was hit? Was <span class="person">Hore
            Ruthven?</span> "As to <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>," I say, "my confidence in that Officer is
         complete. I did not select him; <span class="person">you</span> gave him to me and I have ever since
         felt most grateful to <span class="person">you</span> for <span class="person">your</span> choice."</p>
      
      
      <p>Now--I feel better.</p>
      
      
      <p>The plot thickens. A cable just come in from the S. of S. for War:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"The following statement has been made in letter to Prime Minister,
         <span class="location">Australia</span>, by Mr.<span class="person">Murdoch</span>: 'The fact is that after the first day at
         <span class="location">Suvla</span> an order had to be issued to officers to shoot without mercy any
         soldier who lagged behind or loitered in advance.' Wire me as to the
         truth or otherwise of this allegation."</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Murdoch</span> must be mad. Or, is there some method in this madness?</p>
      
      
      <p>Mr.<span class="person">Murdoch</span> was not a war correspondent; <span class="person">he</span> is purely a civilian and
         could hardly have invented this "order" on <span class="person">his</span> own. No soldier could
         have told <span class="person">him</span> this. Someone not a soldier--someone so interested in
         discrediting the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> Campaign that he does not scruple to do so
         even by discrediting our own troops must have put this invention about,
         per  <span class="person">Murdoch</span>. Doubtless we strike here upon the source of these
         "unofficial statements" which have been flowing into the War Office.
         All I remember of <span class="person">his</span> visit to me here is a sensible, well-spoken man
         with dark eyes, who said <span class="person">his</span> mind was a blank about soldiers and
         soldiering, and made me uncomfortable by an elaborate explanation of why
         <span class="person">his</span> duty to <span class="location">Australia</span> could be better done with a pen than with a rifle.
         <span class="person">He</span> was one week at the Press Correspondents' camp and spent, so they
         tell me, a few hours only at Anzac and <span class="location">Suvla</span>, never once crossing to
         <span class="location">Helles</span>. If then <span class="person">his</span> letter to <span class="person">his</span> Prime Minister is a fair sample of the
         grounds upon which <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> has been condemned, Heaven help us all!</p>
      
      
      <p>As a relief to these disagreeable thoughts, a Taube dropped a couple of
         bombs into camp. She flew so high that she was hard to see until the
         bursting shrapnel gave us her line. As she made tracks back through the
         trackless blue, the ships gave her a taste of some big projectiles,
         12-inches or 9.2. The aerial commotion up there must have been
         considerable.</p>
      
      
      <p>At noon, sailed over to <span class="location">Suvla</span> in H.M.S.  Savage . We took our lunch on
         board. As we came into harbour the Turks gave us a shell or two from
         their field guns, then stopped. <span class="person">Young Titchfield</span>, the <span class="person">Duke of Portland's</span>
         son, met us at the beach and brought us along to <span class="person">Byng</span>'s Headquarters,
         where I met also de <span class="person">Lisle</span> and <span class="person">Reed</span>. After hearing their news I started
         off with the whole band to make a tour of the trenches held by the <span class="unit">88th</span>
         Brigade, under <span class="person">General Cayley</span>. On the way I was taken up to "Gibraltar"
         observation post to get a bird's-eye view of the line. Besides my old
         friends of the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> I saw some of the new boys, especially the
         <span class="unit">1st Newfoundland Battalion</span> under <span class="person">Colonel Burton,</span> and the 2/1st Coy. of
         the <span class="location">London</span> Regiment. This was the Newfoundlanders' first day in the
         trenches and they were very pleased with themselves. They could not
         understand why they were not allowed to sally forth at once and do the
         Turks in. The presence of these men from our oldest colony adds to the
         extraordinary mix-up of people now fighting on the <span class="location">Peninsula.</span> All the
         materials exist here for bringing off the biblical coup of Armageddon
         excepting only the shell.</p>
      
      
      <p>In the course of these peregrinations I met <span class="person">Marshall</span> of the 53rd
         Division, Beresford, commanding the 86th Brigade, and Colonel Savage,
         R.E.</p>
      
      
      <p>After tea with <span class="person">Byng</span>, including the rare treat of a slice of rich cake,
         we went down to our friend <span class="location">H.M.S.  Savage .</span> The wind had risen to a
         fairly stiff gale, and the sea was beginning to get very big. Those
         field gun shells had caused the <span class="location"> Savage </span> to lie a desperate long way out
         to sea; we had a very stiff pull in the teeth of the waves, and every
         one of us began to think that salt water rather than the bullet was
         going to end our days. However, we just managed by the skin of our teeth
         and the usual monkey tricks, to scramble up on board. As I said in my
         wrath when I first stood on the firm deck, I would sooner have a hundred
         shells fired at me by the Turks.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">"Captain Davidson</span> commanding <span class="location">H.M.S.  Cornwallis </span> dined; everyone liked
         him very much.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 6th October, 1915.  Left General Headquarters soon after 11 o'clock for
         <span class="location">Helles</span>, taking with me Aspinall and <span class="person">Freddie</span>. Lunched with <span class="person">Davies</span> at 8th
         Corps Headquarters.</p>
      
      
      <p>Afterwards rode across to <span class="unit">Royal Naval Division</span> and saw Paris. Then went
         with <span class="person">Bertie Lawrence</span>, commanding <span class="unit">52nd Division</span>, to <span class="person">his</span> lines. Our route
         lay up <span class="location">Achi Baba</span> Nallah and along the trenches to the Horse Shoe; then
         along Princes Street trench up the Vineyard, and back along the Krithia
         Nallah to the Headquarters of the <span class="unit">156th Brigade</span>. There we mounted our
         horses and rode back to Corps Headquarters. I brought <span class="person">Steward</span> back with
         me to dine and sleep the night. <span class="person">Colonel Tyrrell</span> and <span class="person">Major Hunloke</span>
         (King's Messenger) also dined.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p> 7th October, 1915.  Wasted energy brooding over the addled eggs of the
         past. Are the High Gods bringing our new Iliad to grief in a spirit of
         wanton mischief? At whose door will history leave the blame for the
         helpless, hopeless fix we are left in--rotting with disease and told to
         take it easy?</p>
      
      
      <p>That clever fellow <span class="person">Deedes</span> dined; also Rowan Hamilton, son of my old
         <span class="person">Simla</span> friend the Colonel of that name.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 8th October, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  At 11 a.m. <span class="person">Ellison</span>, <span class="person">Taylor</span>, <span class="person">Gascoigne</span> and
         <span class="person">Freddie</span> sailed with me for <span class="location">Anzac</span>. There we lunched with the ascetic
         <span class="person">Birdie</span> and Staff off bully beef, biscuits and water. Then, the whole lot
         of us, together with <span class="person">de Crespigny</span>, <span class="person">Birdie</span>'s Staff Officer, hurried five
         miles an hour down the communication trench to the Headquarters of the
         <span class="location">Indian</span> Brigade. After greetings we shoved on and saw the 2nd Lovat
         Scouts under <span class="person">Lieutenant-Colonel Stirling</span> and met, whilst going round
         their line, <span class="person">Major Morrison Bell</span> and <span class="person">Captain Oppenheim.</span> They seemed in
         very good fettle, and it would have been hard to find a finer lot of
         men. Taking leave of the 2nd Lovat Scouts, we worked along the trenches
         of the Fife and Forfar Yeomanry, under Colonel <span class="person">Mitchell</span>, until we came
         to the 1st Lovat Scouts under <span class="person">Colonel Bailey.</span> <span class="person">Lovat</span> himself was sick,
         but <span class="person">Peyton</span> commanding the <span class="unit">2nd Mounted Division</span> turned up just when the
         inspection was at an end. <span class="person">He</span> had got lost in the trenches, or we had.
         Next time the way was lost there was no mistake as to who had made the
         mistake. <span class="person">Birdie</span> and I were pushing along as fast as we could leg it back
         towards <span class="location">Anzac</span>. In the maze of trenches we came to a dividing of the
         ways. Two jolly old Sikhs were sitting at the junction. I asked if the
         road to the left led to the Headquarters of the <span class="location">Indian</span> Brigade. They
         said, "Yes," so on we went, I leading, <span class="person">Birdie</span> following. The trench got
         shallower and shallower until, in a little grove of trees, it petered
         out entirely. But it seemed to begin again in the other side and so we
         crossed through the trees. Once there we found that the supposed trench
         was only a shallow scratching up of the earth, and that we were standing
         within a hundred yards of the <span class="location">Turkish</span> lines just about half way between
         them and the Lovat Scouts! I shouted to <span class="person">Birdie</span> and we turned and ran for
         it--for our lives, I mean. Luckily the Turks were slow at spotting us,
         all except one who was a rank bad shot: so tumbling back into the
         trenches from which we had emerged, we saved ourselves by the skin of
         our teeth. I could not have been smarter about dodging two or three
         bullets had it been the beginning of our enterprise and had the high
         minarets of <span class="location">Constantinople</span> glittered before my eyes.</p>
      
      
      <p>When we got back to where the two old Sikhs were sitting, as placid as
         idols, <span class="person">Birdie</span> gave them <span class="person">his</span> opinion of their ancestors. On reaching the
         <span class="location">Australia</span> and <span class="location">New Zealand</span> Division we were done to a turn, but <span class="person">Godley</span>
         revived us with tea and then we made our way back to our destroyer and
         to Headquarters. It was dark when we arrived and a bad storm was setting
         in--wind and rain--which went on till midnight.</p>
      
      
      <p>Replies have come in to our enquiries as to Mr.<span class="person">Murdoch</span>'s statement to
         the Prime Minister of <span class="location">Australia</span> that <span class="location">British</span> Officers had been ordered
         to "shoot without mercy any soldier who lagged behind or loitered." As
         the Secretary of State seems to take this charge seriously, I thought it
         well, before I sent my answer, just to make sure that no subordinate had
         said, or done, or written anything which could plausibly be twisted into
         this lie. The Generals have denied indignantly; are furious, in fact, at
         the double insult to their men and to themselves.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have cabled accordingly:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"(No. M.F.A.B. 4491). From General Sir <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span> to Secretary of
         State for War. With reference to your No. 8554 M.O. 414 of the 5th inst.
         I have  pro forma  made full enquiries and I find that there is no
         truth whatever in the allegation made by <span class="person">Murdoch</span>."</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p> 9th October, 1915.  Had made my  band-o-bast  for running over to
         <span class="location">Helles</span>, but the Vice-Admiral cabled he wanted to see me if he could at
         11.45. Anyway the sea is still a bit rough for the crossing and landing.
         A lot of damage was done last night to the Anzac piers, two of them
         being clean washed away. Peter Pollen is off colour. <span class="person">Freddie</span> and I dined
         on board the  <span class="location">Triad</span> .</p>
      
      
      <p>Whilst at dinner got full reports both from <span class="location">Suvla</span> and <span class="location">Anzac</span> as to the
         effects of the storm. The southerly gale, which not only washed away the
         piers but sunk the water lighters at <span class="location">Anzac</span>, has done no harm at <span class="location">Suvla</span>
         except that three motor lighters have been driven ashore. The Admiral is
         clear that, during southerly gales we shall have to supply both <span class="location">Anzac</span>
         and <span class="location">Suvla</span> by the new pier just north of Ari Burnu. The promontory is
         small but last night it gave complete protection to everything in its
         lea. By sinking an old ship we can turn Ari Burnu into quite a decent
         little harbour.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 10th October, 1915.  Made my deferred visit to <span class="location">Helles</span>, going over this
         morning in the <span class="location"> Arno </span> with <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>, <span class="person">Val</span> and <span class="person">Alec McGrigor</span>. Looked in
         at the Clearing Hospital and cast an eye over Lancashire Landing. Then,
         in company with <span class="person">Jimmy Watson</span> and <span class="person">Colonel Ayres,</span> walked up to Corps
         Headquarters where we had a fine lunch with <span class="person">Davies</span>, <span class="person">de Rougemont</span> and the
         melancholy <span class="person">Yarr</span>. Afterwards rode across to the Headquarters of the
         <span class="unit">Royal Naval Division</span> and on to their trenches, some 3-1/2 miles.
         <span class="person">Generals Mercer</span> and <span class="person">Paris</span> followed us through their trenches. The <span class="unit">Hood</span>
         and <span class="unit">Hawke Battalions</span> were in the firing line where we talked to great
         numbers of old comrades of all ranks. Glad to meet <span class="person">Freyberg</span> again (the
         man who swam to light the flares at Enos). <span class="person">Kelly</span> of the <span class="unit">Hood Battalion</span>
         too, I saw, and <span class="person">Fairfax</span> of the <span class="unit">Hawke</span>, also <span class="person">Commander King</span> of the <span class="unit">Drake
            Battalion</span> and <span class="person">Burrows</span>, a gunner who was running a bombing school with
         much zeal on a piece of ground specially patronized by the Turks as a
         target for their own shelling practice. Got back to <span class="location">Helles</span> by the Saghur
         Dere and the Gulley. Going down the Gulley, nearly lost two of our
         attendant Generals, a shrapnel bursting between them with a startling
         loud report caused by the high banks of the Gulley on either side.</p>
      
      
      <p>In the Gulley we met a swarm of old friends from <span class="location">Kent</span>; <span class="person">Brigadier-General
            Clifton-Browne</span>, an officer whose command I had inspected both at
         <span class="location">Potchefstroom</span> and near <span class="location">Canterbury</span>, with a Brigade of West and East Kent
         and Sussex Yeomen. They made a brave showing, but <span class="person">he</span> tells me some of
         them have caught this wretched enteritis already. Amongst others, I
         spoke to <span class="person">Douglas</span>, commanding the <span class="unit">East Lancashire Division</span>, <span class="person">Major Edwards</span>
         of the Sussex Yeomanry, <span class="person">Major Sir S. Scott</span> and <span class="person">Colonel Whitburn</span> of the
         West Kent Yeomanry, Colonel Lord Guilford, East Kent Yeomanry. A
         cheerier crowd no one could wish to meet. If these are the type of men
         who spin black yarns for home wear, I can only say that not the most
         finished actors could better disguise their despair. <span class="person">General King</span>, R.A.,
         rode part of the way back with us.</p>
      
      
      <p>After all this hard exercise, got back to the <span class="location"> Arno </span> in a lather of
         sweat about 6 o'clock carrying <span class="person">Davies</span> with me. <span class="person">Leslie Wilson</span>, commanding
         the <span class="unit">Hawke Battalion</span>, had gone sick to-day, so sent <span class="person">him</span> a telegram after
         dinner to the Hospital ship  Somali , telling <span class="person">him</span> <span class="person">his</span> trenches had been
         found in apple-pie order.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 11th October, 1915.  Bad night with this beastly complaint. <span class="person">De Robeck</span>
         came up at 11 o'clock to see me. <span class="person">He</span> has had a message from the Admiralty
         asking him what number of extra troops could be maintained on the
         <span class="location">Peninsula</span> if the units there now were brought up to strength. The
         Admiral asked me for the figures and the A.G. brought them over. My
         force as a whole is as near as may be to half strength. Half of that
         half are sick men. We have 100,000 men on the Peninsula, 50,000 of whom
         are unfit: if the unfits were up to strength there would be 200,000 men
         on the Peninsula as well as excitement and movement which would greatly
         reduce the disease. Bearing in mind that the Anzacs have been well
         supported by their Governments and that their units are fairly strong,
         these figures show what wait-and-see-sickness has meant to <span class="location">British</span>
         Regiments.</p>
      
      
      <p>The tone of this Admiralty question had seemed cheerful: almost as if
         the Higher Direction were thinking of putting us on our legs but, in
         the evening, another cable from <span class="person">Lord K.</span> gave a different and a very ominous
         complexion to the future:--</p>
      
      
      <p>"From <span class="person">Earl Kitchener</span> to General Sir <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span>. What is <span class="person">your</span> estimate
         of the probable losses which would be entailed to your force if the
         evacuation of the <span class="location">Gallipoli</span> Peninsula was decided on and carried out in
         the most careful manner?</p>
      
      
      <p>"No decision has been arrived at yet on this question of evacuation, but
         <span class="person">I</span> feel that <span class="person">I</span> ought to have your views.</p>
      
      
      <p>"In <span class="person">your</span> reply <span class="person">you</span> need not consider the possible future danger to the
         <span class="location">Empire</span> that might be thus caused."[15]</p>
      
      
      <p>If they do this they make the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> into the bloodiest tragedy of
         the world! Even if we were to escape without a scratch, they would stamp
         our enterprise as the bloodiest of all tragedies! <span class="person">Lord K.</span> has always sworn by
         all <span class="person">his</span> Gods <span class="person">he</span> would have no hand in it. I won't touch it, and I think
         <span class="person">he</span> knew that and calculated on that when <span class="person">he</span> cabled. Anyway, let <span class="person">Lord K.</span>, cat
         or Cabinet leap where they will, I must sleep upon my answer, but that
         answer will be NO!</p>
      
      
      <p>Just as I am turning in, a cable from the S. of S. saying, "there is an
         idea that Sir John <span class="person">Maxwell</span> is not sending you as many troops as <span class="person">he</span> might
         from <span class="location">Egypt</span>. Have you any complaints on this score?" Rather late in the
         day this "idea." Certainly, I have never made any "complaints" and I
         don't mean to do so now. The War Office have only to look up their
         returns and see how many men are being maintained to defend us from the
         Senoussi!</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Maxwell</span> has never had less than 70,000 troops in <span class="location">Egypt</span>, a country which
         might have been held with 10,000 rifles--ever since we landed here, that
         is to say. My troops can sail back to <span class="location">Egypt</span> very much faster than the
         Turks--or the Senoussi for that matter--can march to the Canal.</p>
      
      
      <p>In the same cable the S. of S. asks what is the cause of the sick rate
         and remarks that, "some accounts from the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> indicate that the
         men are dispirited." Small wonder if they were! When they see two
         Divisions taken away from the <span class="location">Peninsula</span>; when their guns can't answer
         those of the enemy; when each unit finds itself half-strength, and
         falling--why then, tumbling as they do to the fact that we won't get
         through till next year, they  ought  to be unhappy. But the funny thing
         is that the Cabinet, the Secretaries of State, are the people who are
         "dispirited" and  not  the people out here. If the P.M. could walk round
         the trenches of the Naval Division at <span class="location">Helles</span>, or if <span class="person">Lord K.</span> could exchange
         greetings with the rank and file at <span class="location">Anzac</span> and <span class="location">Suvla</span>, they would find a
         sovereign antidote for the blues and would realize that it was they who
         were down-hearted and  not  the men at the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>. There was an
         old French Colonel, killed at Gravelotte; he had studied the classic
         world battles and he shows that it was never the front line who gave way
         first, but always the reserves:--they, the reserves, watched bloodshed
         in cold blood until they could stand it no longer and so took to their
         heels whilst the fighting men were still focussed upon victory. Not the
         enemy in front but the friends behind are the men who spread despondency
         and alarm.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Charley Burn</span> has arrived on the <span class="location"> Imogene </span> with <span class="person">Dawnay</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Davies</span> went back to <span class="location">Helles</span> after tea. <span class="person">Dawnay</span> says <span class="person">Lord K.</span> was most interested
         in <span class="person">him</span> and most charming to <span class="person">him</span> all through <span class="person">his</span> stay until <span class="person">his</span> last
         interview just before <span class="person">he</span> started on <span class="person">his</span> return journey. <span class="person">Lord K.</span>'s manner
         then, <span class="person">he</span> said, had changed--so much so as to give <span class="person">him</span> an impression that
         the great man was turning, or was being turned, against all of us out
         here. <span class="person">Lord K.</span>'s conduct at the first meetings is in full harmony with <span class="person">his</span>
         message sent to <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> for me by <span class="person">Fitz</span> about a fortnight ago, saying
         I possessed <span class="person">his</span> fullest confidence. The change of manner was marked and
         <span class="person">Dawnay</span> is sure <span class="person">he</span> made no mistake about it. But nothing has happened
         since the date of <span class="person">Dawnay</span>'s arrival and departure save a very well
         engineered withdrawal of the <span class="unit">10th</span> and the French Divisions for which, in
         point of fact, we have all been rather expecting congratulations. <span class="person">Dawnay</span>
         thinks some queer things are happening. <span class="person">He</span> could--or would--say nothing
         more.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 12th October, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  Early in the morning got off my answer to
         <span class="person">Lord K.</span>'s evacuation cable. The elements, the enemy and ourselves are the
         three factors of the problem. Were I to measure my problem by the night
         flitting of the Irish and French Divisions (who lost neither man nor
         beast in the process), I could guarantee that we would shoot the moon
         with the balance of the force smoothly, swiftly and silently. That is to
         say, supposing the Turks and the weather remain constant. But these are
         two most inconstant things: no one can tell how a Turk will behave under
         any given conditions; the Turks themselves do not know how they will
         behave: the weather now is written down by the meteorologists for sudden
         changes; for storms. Unsettled weather is due and ought to be reckoned
         upon. Imagine a blow coming up from the South when the evacuation is
         half way through. That does not seem to be, and is not, any great
         stretch of imagination. Well then, having so imagined, we get a disaster
         only equalled in history by that of the <span class="location">Athenians</span> at <span class="location">Syracuse</span>: a
         disaster from which the <span class="location">British Empire</span> could hardly hope to recover.</p>
      
      
      <p>Twice backwards and forwards to the General Staff Marquee with the draft
         of my guesses, my first being that we would probably lose 35 to 45 per
         cent. But the General Staff have also been consulting their oracle and
         were clear for 50 per cent. Months of the most anxious calculations will
         not get a white man one whit forrarder in seeing into the brains of an
         Asiatic Army or in forecasting Mediterranean weather. Safest to assume
         that both brains and weather will behave as the German General Staff
         would wish them to behave rather than as they chanced to behave when the
         French and Irish went off a few days ago. So have ended by taking the
         Staff's figure because any figure being, in any case, the wildest of
         shots, their shot best suits my views on the issue.</p>
      
      
      <p>"From General Sir <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span> to <span class="person">Earl Kitchener</span>. Our losses would
         depend on such uncertain factors, enemy's action or inaction, weather,
         question whether we could rely on all troops covering embarkation to
         fight to the last, that impossible to give you straight answer
         especially until I have permission to consult Admiral. Once discussing
         this very problem with General <span class="person">Gouraud</span>, we came to the conclusion that
         at Cape <span class="location">Helles</span> we must sacrifice two divisions out of total of six
         divisions and Cape <span class="location">Helles</span> easiest of three places to get away from. My
         opinion now is that it would not be wise to reckon on getting out of
         <span class="location">Gallipoli</span> with less loss than that of half the total force as well as
         guns, which must be used to the last, stores, railway plant and horses.
         Moral of those who got off would fall very low. One quarter would
         probably get off quite easily, then the trouble would begin. We might be
         very lucky and lose considerably less than I have estimated. On the
         other hand, with all these raw troops at <span class="location">Suvla</span> and all these Senegalese
         at Cape <span class="location">Helles</span>, we might have a veritable catastrophe."</p>
      
      
      <p>Do the men toying with the idea of bringing off our men not see that
         thereby the Turks will be let loose somewhere; not nowhere? Do they not
         see that if they are feeling the economic pinch of keeping their side of
         the show in being, the Turks, much weaker economically, must be feeling
         it much more--!</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>It was a relief to get this perilous stuff off my chest, and in a
         brighter frame of mind, sailed for <span class="location">Anzac</span> on the destroyer <span class="location"> Lewis .</span> We
         took biscuits and bully beef with us but the hospitable sailors insisted
         on regaling us with a hot meal. Sat in cabin all the way as usual
         writing up my record. <span class="person">Freddie</span> tells me that these studious habits of
         mine have started the shave that I spend my time composing poetry,
         especially during our battles!</p>
      
      
      <p>At <span class="location">Anzac</span> <span class="person">Birdwood</span> took us round the trenches and underground passages
         about <span class="person">Russell</span>'s Top and Turk's Head, held by the <span class="unit">5th Brigade</span>, <span class="unit">2nd</span>
         Division, under <span class="person">Legge</span>. Half way up to <span class="person">Russell</span>'s Top was the 3rd Battery
         <span class="location">Australia</span> Field Artillery:--talked with Major King, the C.O. Next unit
         was the <span class="unit">20th Infantry Battalion</span> under <span class="person">Major Fitzgerald.</span> <span class="person">Colonel Holmes,</span>
         commanding the <span class="unit">5th Infantry Brigade,</span> and <span class="person">Wilson</span>, <span class="person">his</span> Brigade Major, took
         us through their cave dwellings. Ex-westerners say that in <span class="location">France</span> they
         have nothing to touch these <span class="location">Australia</span> tunnellings. In one place they
         are boring into a crater only 20 feet from the <span class="location">Turkish</span> trench. There is
         nothing unusual in the fact, but there is in the great depth they are
         going down so as to cross the danger zone far below the beaten track of
         mines and counter-mines. On the steep slope in another place there is a
         complete underground trench running parallel to, and only a short
         bomb-throw from, a <span class="location">Turkish</span> trench. We went through it with a lantern.
         Sandbags, loopholes, etc., all are there, but blind! They are still
         veiled from view by several feet of clay. To-morrow night the Anzacs are
         going to chip off the whole upper crust of earth, and when light dawns
         the Turks will find a well equipped trench, every loophole manned,
         within bombing range of their own line.</p>
      
      
      <p>Other notables met with were <span class="person">Major Murphy</span> of the <span class="unit">20th Infantry
            Battalion</span>, <span class="person">Major Anderson</span> (an old friend) commanding the <span class="location">Australia</span>
         Field Artillery, and <span class="person">Captain Perry Oakdene</span>, the Engineer Officer on the
         job. Saw <span class="person">Birdie</span> and returned in the destroyer about 6.30. The day had
         been so quiet that it would have been almost dull had it not been for
         the sightseeing--hardly a shot was fired by Turk or Anzac with either
         gun, trench mortar or rifle.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Bishop Price</span>, the Bishop of North China, and <span class="person">Charlie Burn</span>, King's
         Messenger, dined. The quietness of the Bishop was remarkable.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have cabled the S. of S. for War in answer to his enquiries about the
         causes of the sickness, and as to whether <span class="person">Maxwell</span> is not holding up my
         share of troops in <span class="location">Egypt</span>, saying:--(1) that "constant strain and
         infection by dust and flies" have caused the sickness but that the men
         are getting better; (2) that "we have been under the impression that
         drafts meant for us and due to us have been retained in <span class="location">Egypt</span>; also,
         that men discharged fit from Hospitals have been held back, but I have
         represented this last point to <span class="person">Maxwell</span> personally as I always feel I am
         not the person to gauge <span class="person">Maxwell</span>'s needs. On 27th September, I asked him
         to send up all available <span class="location">Australia</span>--<span class="location">New Zealand</span> Army Corps drafts and
         reinforcements, and, as you already know, am at present in telegraphic
         correspondence about these reinforcements coming straight here without
         being kept in <span class="location">Egypt</span> for training at all."</p>
      
      
      <p>At 10.40, after clearing my table, went with <span class="person">Ellison</span>, <span class="person">Taylor</span>, and
         <span class="person">Freddie</span> on board <span class="location">H.M.S.  Lefroy </span> (Commander Edwards) and steamed for "V"
         Beach. Enjoyed a fine luncheon with <span class="person">Brulard</span> and then started off for the
         trenches. At <span class="location">Morto Bay</span> we were met by <span class="person">Captain de Bourbon</span>, a big handsome
         man with the characteristic <span class="person">Bourbon</span> cut of countenance. <span class="person">He</span> took us first
         to the  château  whence we worked down along the trenches to where our
         extreme right overlooks the Kerevez Dere. <span class="person">General Faukard</span> was here and
         <span class="person">he</span> thinks that we ought easily to get complete mastery of both sides of
         the Kerevez Dere as soon as we get the means and the permission to shove
         ahead again. When we do that the advance will let our Fleet another half
         mile up the Straits and the "spotting" for the ships' guns will double
         their value in the Narrows. From the Kerevez Dere we worked along the
         fire trenches towards the French centre and then, getting to a sheltered
         strip of country, walked back across the open to the second line. From
         the second line we made our way, still across the open, to the third
         line, over a heather covered strip. No one ever moves here by daylight
         except in double quick time as there is always danger of drawing a shell
         either from Asia or from <span class="location">Achi Baba</span> and so it was that "Let the dead
         bury the dead" had been the motto and that we met many corpses and
         skeletons. Merciful God, what home tragedies may centre in each of these
         sinister bundles. But it is the common lot--only quicker. Here, too, we
         found excavations made by the French into a burial ground believed to be
         of the date 2,500 B.C. The people of that golden age had the sentimental
         idea of being buried in couples in big jars. A strange notion of our
         Allies unburying quiet people who had enjoyed dreamless rest for 2,000
         years whilst, within a few yards, their own dead still welter in the
         parching wind.</p>
      
      
      <p>[Illustration: CREMATING THE ENEMY DEAD  "Central News" phot. ]</p>
      
      
      <p>Had meant to run across and see <span class="person">Davies</span> but time had slipped away and so
         we made tracks for <span class="location">H.M.S.  Lefroy </span>, and on back here to G.H.Q., where a
         letter from <span class="person">Callwell</span> was laying in wait as a refresher after my
         fatigues.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Callwell</span> begins by saying <span class="person">he</span> encloses a document written by my late
         visitor, Mr. <span class="person">Lord K.</span> A. <span class="person">Murdoch</span>, although "there are certain statements in
         this which are palpably false," and although <span class="person">Dawnay</span> has pointed out to
         him at the War Office "a number of passages in it which are wholly
         incorrect as matters of actual fact." <span class="person">He</span> says, <span class="person">Lord K.</span>, "who has not had
         ime to read it yet," thinks I ought to be given a chance of defending
         myself.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Callwell</span> goes on to write about the Press Censorship and my plea for
         publicity and then says <span class="person">he</span> dislikes the <span class="location">Salonika</span> stunt "because I am not
         quite clear of where we are going to, and the immediate result at the
         present is to take away from you troops that you can ill spare." Also,
         because "we may be involving ourselves in operations on a great scale in
         the heart of the Balkans, the result of which it is very difficult to
         foresee."</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Godley</span> dined. <span class="person">Captain Davidson</span>, R.N., the Senior Naval Officer in
         harbour now, is a real Godsend. He looks after us as if we were Admirals
         of the Fleet.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have now read, marked, learnt and inwardly indigested <span class="person">Callwell</span>'s
         enclosure; viz., the letter written by Mr. <span class="person">Lord K.</span> A. <span class="person">Murdoch</span> to the Prime
         Minister of <span class="location">Australia</span>. Quite a Guy Fawkes epistle. <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> is "more
         cordially detested in our forces than <span class="person">Enver Pasha</span>." "You will trust me
         when I  say that the work of the General Staff in <span class="location">Gallipoli</span> is
         deplorable." "Sedition is talked round every tin of bully beef on the
         Peninsula." "You would refuse to believe that these men were really
         <span class="location">British</span> soldiers ... the <span class="location">British</span> physique is very much below that of the
         Turks. Indeed, it is quite obviously so. Our men have found it
         impossible to form a high opinion of the <span class="location">British</span> <span class="person">Lord K.</span> men and
         Territorials. They are merely a lot of childlike youths, without
         strength to endure or brains to improve their conditions." "I shall
         always remember the stricken face of a young English Lieutenant when I
         told him he must make up his mind for a winter campaign." "I do not like
         to dictate this sentence, even for your eyes, but the fact is that after
         the first day at <span class="location">Suvla</span> an order had to be issued to Officers to shoot
         without mercy any soldier who lagged behind or loitered in an advance."</p>
      
      
      <p>Well, Well! I should not worry myself over the out-pourings of our late
         guest, who has evidently been made a tool of by some unscrupulous
         person, were it not that <span class="person">Mr.Asquith</span> has clothed the said out-pourings
         in the title, number, garb and colour of a verified and authentic State
         paper. <span class="person">He</span> has actually had them printed on the famous duck's egg
         foolscap of the Committee of Imperial Defence, and under <span class="person">his</span> authority,
         as President and Prime Minister, they have been circulated round the
         Government and all the notables of the Empire without any chance having
         been offered to me (or to <span class="person">Lord K.</span>) of defending the honour of <span class="location">British</span>
         Officers or the good name of the <span class="location">British</span> Rank and File. <span class="person">Lord K.</span> tells
         <span class="person">Callwell</span> I should be given the opportunity of making a reply. Not having
         read it himself <span class="person">he</span> has not yet grasped the fact that <span class="person">he</span> also should have
         been given the opportunity of making a reply to the aspersions upon <span class="person">his</span>
         selections. As for me, by the time my answer can get home and can be
         printed and circulated the slanders will have had over a month's start
         in <span class="location">England</span> and very likely two months' start in <span class="location">Australia</span>, where all who
         read them will naturally conclude their statements must have been tested
         before ever they were published in that impressive form.</p>
      
      
      <p>Here we see an irresponsible statement by an ignorant man and I
         instinctively feel as if it were being used as one more weapon to force
         <span class="person">Asquith's</span> hand and to ruin our last chance. I only hope it may not prove
         another case of, "Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!"</p>
      
      
      <p>Certain aspects of this affair trouble my understanding. The covering
         note (dated 25th September) which encloses the letter to the Prime
         Minister of <span class="location">Australia</span> (dated 23rd September) is addressed by Mr.<span class="person">Murdoch</span>
         to <span class="person">Mr.Asquith</span> by name. In that covering note Mr.<span class="person">Murdoch</span> says, "I write
         with diffidence, and only at Mr. <span class="person">Lloyd George</span>'s request." Within three
         days (so great the urgency or pressure) <span class="person">Mr.Asquith</span> causes--as <span class="person">he</span>,
         President of the Committee of Imperial Defence, alone can cause--the
         covering note as well as the seven or eight thousand words of the letter
         to be printed and circulated round the big wigs of Politics, as well as
         (to judge by the co-incident hardening of the tone of this mail's
         papers) some of the Editors. Not one word to me as to Mr.<span class="person">Murdoch</span>'s
         qualifications or as to the truth or falsity of <span class="person">his</span> statements, until
         these last have been a week in circulation. Then, I receive; first, a
         cable saying unofficial reports had come in censuring my General Staff
         and that I had better, therefore, let <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> go; secondly, a cable
         asking me whether the absurd story of my having ordered my own soldiers
         to be shot "without mercy " is well-founded; thirdly, a bad last, the
         libellous letter itself.</p>
      
      
      <p>Yet <span class="person">Mr.Asquith</span> did know the paper contained  some  falsehoods. <span class="person">He</span>  may 
         have attached weight to Mr.<span class="person">Murdoch</span>'s tale of the feelings of French
         soldiers at <span class="location">Helles</span> (although <span class="person">he</span> never found time to go there): <span class="person">he</span>  may 
         have believed Mr.<span class="person">Murdoch</span> when <span class="person">he</span> says that Sir John <span class="person">Maxwell</span> "has a poor
         brain for <span class="person">his</span> big position"; that "our men feel that their reputation is
         too sacred to leave in the hands of <span class="person">Maxwell</span>"; that <span class="person">Sir William Birdwood</span>
         "has not the fighting quality or big brain of a great General"; that
         <span class="person">General Spens</span> was "a man broken on the Continent" (although <span class="person">he</span> never was
         broken and never served on the Continent); that "<span class="person">Kitchener</span> has a
         terrible task in getting pure work from the General Staff of the <span class="location">British</span>
         Army, whose motives can never be pure, for they are unchangeably
         selfish"; that "from what I saw of the Turk, I am convinced he is ... a
         better man than those opposed to him" (although, actually, Mr.<span class="person">Murdoch</span>
         saw nothing of the Turks). The P.M. may have taken these views at their
         face values: even, <span class="person">he</span>  may  have swallowed Mr.<span class="person">Murdoch</span>'s picture of the
         conscientious <span class="person">Altham</span> "wallowing" in ice whilst wounded were expiring of
         heat within a few hundred yards; but  <span class="person">Mr.Asquith</span> has seen the <span class="person">Lord K.</span> Army 
         and, therefore,  he cannot have believed  that these soldiers have
         suddenly been transformed into "merely a lot of childish youths without
         strength to endure or brains to improve their conditions."</p>
      
      
      <p>Once more; these reckless scraps of hearsay would not be worth the paper
         they are printed on were it not that they are endorsed with the letters
         C.I.D., the stamp of the ministerial Holy of Holies. Only the Prime
         Minister himself, personally, can so consign a paper. <span class="person">Lord K.</span> and I were
         both members of the C.I.D., and members of long standing. For the
         President to circularize our fellow members behind our backs with
         unverified accusations is a strange act, foreign to all my ideas of <span class="person">Mr.
            Asquith.</span> On this point <span class="person">Callwell</span> is quite clear: the <span class="person">Murdoch</span> letter was
         published to the C.I.D. on the 28th ult. and <span class="person">Callwell</span> writes on the 2nd
         inst., and says <span class="person">Lord K.</span> "has not had time to read it yet."[16] But
         nothing else is clear. In fact, the whole thing is foreign to all my
         ideas of <span class="person">Mr.Asquith</span>. <span class="person">He</span> does not need to work the C.I.D. oracle in this
         way. As P.M. <span class="person">he</span> has only to speak the word. <span class="person">He</span> does not work the Press
         oracle either: not <span class="person">his</span> custom: also <span class="person">he</span> likes <span class="person">Lord K.</span> The whole thing is a
         mystery, of which I can only say with Hamlet--"miching mallecho; it
         means mischief."</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 14th October, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  Colder than ever. We are told that the
         winter will kill the flies and that with their death we shall all get
         hearty and well. Meanwhile, they have turned to winged limpets.</p>
      
      
      <p>Being Mail day as well as rough, stuck to camp. My friend <span class="location">England</span> sailed
         into harbour in the <span class="location"> Chelmer </span> and came up to lunch. In the evening he
         took <span class="person">Godley</span> back to <span class="location">Anzac.</span> <span class="person">Duncannon</span> came to dinner. I have made him
         liaison officer with the French in place of de Putron who has gone to
         <span class="location">Salonika</span> with <span class="person">Bailloud</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>As to the <span class="person">Murdoch</span> unpleasantness, I began an  exposé  to be sent to the
         Governor General of <span class="location">Australia</span>; another to the Secretary of the C.I.D.
         But <span class="person">Pollen</span>, <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> and <span class="person">Dawnay</span> (the last of whom had been shown the
         document whilst <span class="person">he</span> was at home, though <span class="person">he</span> had said nothing to me about
         it) thought this was to make much ado about nothing. They cannot believe
         <span class="person">Lord K.</span> will trouble himself about the matter any further and they think
         it best handled in lighter vein. Is <span class="person">Lord K.</span> still the demi-God, that is the
         question? Anyway, there is simply no time this Mail to deal with so many
         misstatements, so that has settled it.</p>

         "MEDTN. EXPEDITIONARY FORCE,
         "14th October, 1915. </p>
      
      
      <p>  "DEAR CALLWELL,</p>
      
      
      <p>"I have read Mr.<span class="person">Murdoch</span>'s letter with care, and I have tried to give it
         my most impartial consideration and not to allow myself in reply to be
         influenced in any way by the criticisms <span class="person">he</span> may have felt himself bound
         to make upon myself personally.</p>
      
      
      <p>"What does this letter amount to? Here we have a man, a journalist by
         profession, one who is quick to seize every point, and to coin epithets,
         which throw each fleeting impression into strongest relief. <span class="person">He</span> comes
         armed with a natural and justifiably enthusiastic admiration for
         everything connected with the Commonwealth to which <span class="person">he</span> belongs, and
         ready to retail to <span class="person">his</span> Minister or <span class="person">his</span> public anything that can
         contribute to show the troops they have sent in an heroic light.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Here <span class="person">he</span> obtains <span class="person">his</span> first sight of war and of the horrors and hardships
         inseparable from it. <span class="person">He</span> finds men who have just been through some of
         the hardest fighting imaginable and who have suffered terrible losses;
         <span class="person">he</span> finds probably that very many of those whom <span class="person">he</span> hoped to see,
         certainly many of those of whose welfare their motherland would wish to
         hear, are killed, wounded or laid up with illness,--<span class="person">he</span> finds all this
         and <span class="person">he</span> becomes very deeply depressed. In such an atmosphere Mr.<span class="person">Murdoch</span>
         composes <span class="person">his</span> letter, a general analysis of which shows it to be divided,
         to <span class="person">my</span> mind, into two separate strata.</p>
      
      
      <p>"First an appreciation in burning terms of the spirit, the achievements,
         the physique and all soldierly qualities of the <span class="location">Australia</span> Forces.
         Secondly, a condemnation, as sweeping and as unrelieved as <span class="person">his</span> praise in
         the first instance is unstinted, of the whole of the rest of the force.
         I myself as C.-in-C., my Generals, my Staff, Lines of Communication, Sir
         John <span class="person">Maxwell</span> and <span class="person">General Spens</span> at the Base, even the <span class="location">British</span> soldiers
         collectively and individually, are all embraced in this condemnation
         which is completed by the inclusion of the entire direction of the
         Forces at home, both Naval and Military.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Where all are thus tarred with the same brush, I am content to leave it
         to the impartial reader to decide what reliance can be placed on Mr.
         <span class="person">Murdoch</span>'s judgment. My own feeling certainly is that in <span class="person">his</span> admiration
         for the <span class="location">Australia</span> Forces, and in <span class="person">his</span> grief at their heavy losses (in
         both of which feelings I fully share) <span class="person">he</span> has allowed himself to belittle
         and to criticize us all so that their virtues might be thrown into even
         bolder relief.</p>
      
      
      <p>"With Mr.<span class="person">Murdoch's</span> detailed points I do not propose to deal, nor do I
         think you expect me to do so. On every page inaccuracies of fact abound.
         The breaking of Spens on the Continent, a theatre of war <span class="person">he</span> has never
         visited; the over-statement of our casualties by more than 40 per cent.;
         the acceptance as genuine of a wholly mythical order about the shooting
         of laggards--really the task would be too long. As to the value of Mr.
         <span class="person">Murdoch</span>'s appreciation of the strategical and tactical elements of the
         situation you can yourself assess them at their true value.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Finally, I do not for one moment believe the general statement put
         forward to the effect that the troops are disheartened. Neither that
         statement nor the assertion that they are discontented with the <span class="location">British</span>
         Officers commanding them has the slightest foundation in fact.</p>
      
      
      <p>                              "Believe me,
         "My dear <span class="person">Callwell</span>,
         "Yours very sincerely,
         ( Sd. ) "IAN HAMILTON.</p>
      
      
      <p>"P.S.--I attach correspondence showing how Mr.<span class="person">Murdoch</span>'s visit arose. I
         believe I exceeded my power in giving <span class="person">him</span> permission to come but I was
         most anxious to oblige the <span class="location">Australia</span> Prime Minister and Senator Pearce.
         You will see that <span class="person">he</span> promises faithfully to observe any conditions I may
         impose. The only condition I imposed was that <span class="person">he</span> should sign a
         declaration identical with that which I attach. <span class="person">He</span> signed and the paper
         is in my possession."</p>

         a war correspondent and <span class="person">his</span> remark about having written <span class="person">me</span> up in the

         ever, that as many journalists as possible should be put into a position
         for seeing the fine things the troops had done and were doing; I noted
         the emphasis laid by the writer upon <span class="person">his</span> acceptance of the censorship,
         and so I took upon myself to exceed my powers and asked <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> to

         forces of any other Power in any capacity, or impart to anyone military
         information of a confidential nature or of a kind such that its
         disclosure is likely to prejudice military operations, which may have
         been acquired by me while with the <span class="location">British</span> Forces in the Field, or
         publish any writing, plan, map, sketch, photograph or other picture on
         military subjects, the material for which has been acquired by me in a
         similar manner, unless first submitted by me to the Chief Field Censor
         for censorship and passed for publication by him.</p>

      <p> 15th October, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  Bitter cold. The whole camp upside down
         and all the Staff busy with their shift of quarters to the other side of
         the Bay.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Altham</span> has been at <span class="location">Salonika</span> and came over to report how things were
         going there. Remembering the accusation of "wallowing" in ice, I nearly
         touched him for a Vanilla cream.</p>
      
      
      <p>As to <span class="location">Salonika</span>, <span class="person">he</span> tells me that, so far, the occupation has been a
         travesty of any military operation. No plan; no administration; much
         confusion; troops immobile and likely to sit for weeks upon the beach.
         The Balkan States Intelligence Officers are on the spot and grasp the
         inferences. Until the troops landed they were not quite sure whether
         some serious factor was not about to be sprung upon them: now they are
         quite sure nothing can happen, big or small, beyond our letting a lot of
         our bayonets go rusty. <span class="person">Sarrail</span> has been implored by the Serbians to push
         <span class="person">his</span> troops up into their country, but <span class="person">he</span> has been wise enough to
         refuse. How can <span class="person">he</span> feed them? On the top of it all, the conduct of the
         Greeks seems fishy. As to the Bulgarians, they have already thrown off
         the mask. Although <span class="location">Salonika</span> is going to be our ruin, I can still spare
         some pity for <span class="person">Sarrail</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Have heard from <span class="person">Birdie</span> who at last gives me leave to see <span class="person">his</span> Lone Pine
         section. Until now I have never been able to get him to let me go there.
         Too many bombs, <span class="person">he</span> says, to make it quite healthy for a
         Commander-in-Chief.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 16th October, 1915. <span class="location">Imbros</span>.  Had just got into bed last night when I
         was ferreted out again by a cable "Secret and personal" from <span class="person">Lord K.</span> telling
         me to decipher the next message myself. The messenger brought a note
         from the G.S.--most of whom have now gone across to the other side of
         the Bay--to ask if I would like to be awakened when the second message
         came in. As I knew the contents as well as if I had written it out
         myself, I said no, that it was to be brought me with the cipher book at
         my usual hour for being called in the morning. When I had given this
         order, my mind dwelt awhile over my sins. Through my tired brain passed
         thought-pictures of philosophers waiting for cups of hemlock and various
         other strange and half-forgotten antique images. Then I fell asleep.</p>
      
      
      <p>Next morning, <span class="person">Peter Pollen</span> came in with the cipher book and the
         bow-string. I got <span class="person">Lord K.</span>'s message pat in my dreams last night and here it
         is, to a word, in black and white:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"The War Council held last night decided that though the Government
         fully appreciate your work and the gallant manner in which you
         personally have struggled to make the enterprise a success in face of
         the terrible difficulties you have had to contend against, they, all the
         same, wish to make a change in the command which will give them an
         opportunity of seeing you."</p>
      
      
      <p>How far we have travelled, in spirit, since <span class="person">Lord K.</span> sent me <span class="person">his</span> September
         greetings with spontaneous assurances of complete confidence! Yet, since
         then, on the ground, I have not travelled at all--have indeed been under
         the order of the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> Committee to stand still.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Charles Munro</span> is to relieve me and brings with him a Chief of Staff who
         will take <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>'s place. On my way back I "might visit <span class="location">Salonika</span>
         and <span class="location">Egypt</span>" so as to be able to give the Cabinet the latest about the
         hang of things in these places.</p>
      
      
      <p>When I go, <span class="person">Birdie</span> is to take my place pending <span class="person">Munro</span>'s arrival.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">De Robeck</span> must give me a cruiser so that we may start for home
         to-morrow. The offer of a jaunt at Government expense to <span class="location">Salonika</span> and
         <span class="location">Egypt</span> leaves me cold. They think nothing of spending some hundreds of
         pounds to put off an awkward moment. What value on earth could my views
         on <span class="location">Salonika</span> and <span class="location">Egypt</span> possess for people who have no use for my views on
         my own subject!</p>
      
      
      <p>After breakfast, read <span class="person">Lord K.</span>'s cable over once more. "A War Council," it
         seems, decided to make the change. Did the War Council also appoint
         <span class="person">Munro</span>? <span class="person">Lord K.</span> did not appoint him--anyway. <span class="person">Munro</span> succeeded me at <span class="location">Hythe.</span> In
         1897 I was brought home from <span class="location">Tirah</span> to <span class="location">Hythe</span> by <span class="person">Evelyn Wood</span> in order that
         I might keep an eye on the original ideas which, from <span class="location">India</span> under <span class="person">Lord
            Roberts</span>, had revolutionized the whole system of <span class="location">British</span> musketry. I left
         <span class="location">Hythe</span> on the outbreak of the <span class="location">South Africa</span>n War and during that war <span class="person">Munro</span>
         went there.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">He</span> was born with another sort of mind from me. Had <span class="person">he</span> been sent out here
         in the first instance <span class="person">he</span> would never have touched the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>, and
         people who have realized so much may conclude <span class="person">he</span> will now clear out. But
         it does not follow. <span class="person">Munro</span>'s refusal to attempt a landing in the first
         instance would have served as the foundation stone for some totally
         different policy in the Near East. That might perhaps have been a good
         plan. But to start a campaign with me and try to carry it on with <span class="person">Munro</span>
         has already been tried and found hardly fair to either of us. The
         intention of whoever selected <span class="person">Munro</span> is so to use him as to force <span class="person">Lord K.</span> to
         pull down the blinds. But they may be mistaken in <span class="person">his</span> character.</p>
      
      
      <p>One thing is sure: whenever I get home I shall do what I can to convince
         <span class="person">Lord K.</span> that the game is still in <span class="person">his</span> hands if only <span class="person">he</span> will shake himself
         free from slippery politics; come right out here and run the show
         himself. <span class="location">Constantinople</span> is the only big big hit lying open on the map at
         this moment. With the reinforcements and munitions <span class="person">Lord K.</span>, as
         Commander-in-Chief, would have at <span class="person">his</span> command, <span class="person">he</span> can bring off the coup
         right away. <span class="person">He</span> has only to borrow a suitable number of howitzers and
         aeroplanes from the Western front and our troops begin to advance.
         <span class="person">Sarrail</span> has missed the chance of twenty generations by not coming here.
         Let <span class="person">Lord K.</span> step in. In the whole of the Near East <span class="person">his</span> name alone is still
         worth an Army Corps. My own chance has gone. That is no reason why my
         old Chief should not himself make good. I told the War Council we held
         at <span class="location">Suvla</span> before the battle of the 21st August that if the Government
         persisted in refusing me drafts and munitions--if they insisted on
         leaving my units at half-strength--then they would have to get someone
         cleverer than myself to carry out the job. Well, it has come to that
         now. <span class="person">Lord K.</span> looms big in the public eye and can insist on not being starved.
         <span class="person">He</span> must hurry up though! Time enough has been lost, God knows. But even
         to-day there is time. Howitzers, trench mortars, munitions, men, on a
         scale <span class="location">France</span> would hardly miss,--the Asiatic side of the Straits would
         be occupied--and, in one month from to-day, our warships will have
         <span class="location">Constantinople</span> under their guns. If <span class="person">Lord K.</span> won't listen to me, then, having
         been officially mis-informed that the War Council wish to see me (the
         last thing they  do  wish), I will take them at their word. I will
         buttonhole every Minister from <span class="person">McKenna</span> and <span class="person">Lloyd George</span> to Asquith and
         Bonar Law,--and grovel at their feet if by doing so I can hold them on
         to this, the biggest scoop that is, or ever has been, open to an
         Empire.</p>
      
      
      <p>Rather a sickly lunch. Not so much the news as the Benger's on which we
         all feasted for our stomach's sake. <span class="person">Birdie</span> came over at 4 p.m. with
         <span class="person">Ruthven</span>. Both <span class="person">his</span> A.D.C.s are sick. I am going to ask him to take on
         young <span class="person">Alec McGrigor</span>. <span class="person">Peter</span> and <span class="person">Freddie</span> will come home with <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>
         and myself. What a true saying,--a friend in need is a friend indeed.
         Were I handing over to <span class="person">Birdie</span> for good I should feel unalloyed happiness
         in <span class="person">his</span> well-deserved success.</p>
      
      
      <p>At tea <span class="person">Ellison</span>, <span class="person">Braithwaite</span>, <span class="person">Bertier</span>, <span class="person">Colonel Sykes</span> and <span class="person">Guest</span> appeared.
         They looked more depressed than I felt. I had to work like a beaver
         before I could brighten them up. "I'm not dead yet," I felt inclined to
         tell them, "no, not by long chalks." What I did say to one or two of
         them was this:--"My credit with Government is exhausted; clearly I can't
         screw men or munitions out of them. The new Commander will start fresh
         with a good balance of faith, hope and charity lodged in the Bank of
         <span class="location">England</span>. He comes with a splendid reputation, and if he is big enough to
         draw boldly on this deposit, the Army will march; the Fleet will steam
         ahead; what has been done will bear fruit, and all our past struggles
         and sacrifices will live."</p>
      
      
      <p>Dined with <span class="person">Freddie</span> on the  <span class="location">Triad</span> . De Robeck and <span class="person">Keyes</span> were all that
         friends can be at such a moment.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> 17th October, 1915. <span class="location"></span>  ( At sea ). A pretty beastly day
         within and without. For the within part, all sorts of good-byes to put
         pain into our hearts; for the without, a cold drizzle chilling us all to
         the bone.</p>
      
      
      <p>At 10.30 <span class="person">Brulard</span> and his Staff came over; also Generals <span class="person">Byng</span> and <span class="person">Davies</span>
         with their Staffs. After bidding them farewell; a function whereat I was
         grateful to the French for their lightness of touch, I rode over with
         <span class="person">Braithwaite</span> and the A.D.C.s to the new Headquarters at Kephalos to say
         good-bye to my own Staff. Although I had meant to live there until we
         drove the Turks far enough back to let us live on the Peninsula, I had
         found time to see my little stone hut built by Greek peasants on the
         side of the hill:--deliciously snug. To-day, this very day, I was to
         have struck my tent and taken up these cosy winter quarters; now I move,
         right enough, but on the wrong road.</p>
      
      
      <p>The adieu was a melancholy affair. There was no make-belief, that's a
         sure thing. Whatever the <span class="location">British</span> Officer may be his forte has never lain
         in his acting. So, by 2.30, I made my last salute to the last of the old
         lot and boarded the  <span class="location">Triad</span> . A baddish wrench parting from <span class="person">de Robeck</span> and
         <span class="person">Keyes</span> with whom I have been close friends for so long. Up to midnight de
         Robeck had intended coming home too. <span class="person">Keyes</span> himself is following me in a
         day or two, to implore the Cabinet to let us at least strike one more
         blow before we haul down our flag, so there will be two of us at the
         task.</p>
      
      
      <p>I wrung their hands. The Bo'sun's whistle sounded. The curtain was
         falling so I wrung their hands once again and said good-bye; good-bye
         also to the <span class="person">Benjamin</span> of my personal Staff, young <span class="person">Alec</span>, who stays on with
         <span class="person">Birdie</span>. A bitter moment and hard to carry through.</p>
      
      
      <p>Boarded the <span class="location"> Chatham </span> (Captain Drury-Lowe) and went below to put my
         cabin straight. The anchor came up, the screws went round. I wondered
         whether I could stand the strain of seeing <span class="location">Imbros</span>, Kephalos, the camp,
         fade into the region of dreams,--I was hesitating when a message came
         from the Captain to say the Admiral begged me to run up on to the
         quarter deck. So I ran, and found the <span class="location"> Chatham </span> steering a corkscrew
         course--threading in and out amongst the warships at anchor. Each as we
         passed manned ship and sent us on our way with the cheers of brave men
         ringing in our ears.</p>

         long been associated. First, <span class="person">he</span> would like them to know <span class="person">his</span> deep sense
         of the honour it has been to command so fine an Army in one of the most
         arduous and difficult Campaigns which has ever been undertaken;
         secondly, <span class="person">he</span> must express to them <span class="person">his</span> admiration at the noble response
         which they have invariably given to the calls <span class="person">he</span> has made upon them. No
         risk has been too desperate; no sacrifice too great. Sir <span class="person">Ian Hamilton</span>
         thanks all ranks, from Generals to private soldiers, for the wonderful
         way they have seconded <span class="person">his</span> efforts to lead them towards that decisive

      <p>[Footnote 14: I think I hardly knew  how  often till I came to read
         through my diary in cold print. But all the time I was conscious, and am
         still more so now, of <span class="person">Lord K.</span>'s greatness. Still more so now because, when I
         compare him with <span class="person">his</span> survivors, they seem measurable, he remains
         immeasurable.</p>
      
      
      <p>I wish very much I could make people admire <span class="person">Lord K.</span> understandingly. To
         praise him wrongly is to do him the worst disservice. The theme can
         hardly be squeezed into a footnote, but one protest must be made all the
         same. Lord Fisher gives fresh currency to the fable that <span class="person">Lord K.</span> was a great
         organizer. <span class="person">Lord K.</span> hated organization with all <span class="person">his</span> primitive heart and soul,
         because it cramped <span class="person">his</span> style.</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="person">Lord K.</span> was an individualist. He was a Master of Expedients; the greatest
         probably the world has ever seen. Whenever <span class="person">he</span> saw  any  organization <span class="person">his</span>
         inclination was to smash it, and often--but not always--he was right.
         This may sound odd in Anglo-Celtic ears. But most <span class="location">British</span> organizations
         are relics of the past. They are better smashed than patched, and <span class="person">Lord K.</span>
         loved smashing.--IAN H., 1920.]</p>
      
      
      <p>[Footnote 15: <span class="person">Lord K.</span>'s reason for putting in this last paragraph may be
         obscure unless I make it clear. As explained in a previous footnote,
         <span class="person">Lord K.</span>knew that I knew <span class="person">his</span> strong personal view that the smashing blow
         to our military reputation which would be caused by an evacuation of the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> must, in course of time, imperil our hold upon <span class="location">Egypt</span>.
         Therefore, for the moment, it was necessary to warn me that the problem
         must be considered in the purely military, tactical, aspect.--IAN H.

      <p>APPENDIX I</p>
      
      
      <p>STATEMENT ON ARTILLERY BY BRIGADIER GENERAL SIR HUGH SIMPSON BAIKIE,
         EX-COMMANDER OF THE BRITISH ARTILLERY AT CAPE HELLES.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>The first landing of <span class="location">British</span> troops at Cape <span class="location">Helles</span> took place on 25th
         April, 1915. On arriving at that place during the first week in May, I
         found that heavy fighting had occurred without ceasing from the time of
         the disembarkation. Having come straight from the Headquarters Staff of
         the 2nd Army in <span class="location">France</span>, where the question of artillery ammunition was a
         constant source of anxiety to all the higher commanders, I at once set
         to work to discover what reserves remained in the hands of G.H.Q. and
         what the daily expenditure had been since the landing. The greatest
         difficulty was experienced in obtaining figures of expenditure from the
         units, so constant had been the fighting, which still continued, and so
         great the casualties, and consequent confusion in reckoning expenditure.
         Yet, after some delay, sufficient information was obtained to enable me
         to demonstrate with certainty that, if such severe fighting continued,
         the Force would soon be in danger of losing their artillery support.</p>
      
      
      <p>On the 4th May a cable was sent, I believe, to <span class="person">Lord Kitchener</span> saying
         that ammunition was becoming a very serious matter owing to the
         ceaseless fighting; pointing out that 18 pr. shell were a vital
         necessity and that a supply promised by a certain ship (I believe the
         S.S.  Funia ) had not turned up. A day or two later, a cable was
         received by G.H.Q. saying munitions were never calculated on a basis of
         prolonged occupation of the Peninsula, and that the War Office would
         have to reconsider the whole position, if more was wanted. If I remember
         aright, the cable finished by saying, "It is important to push on." A
         few days later a cable was received saying the War Office would not give
         us more ammunition until we submitted a return of what was in hand. The
         compilation of that cut-and-dried return in the midst of a desperate
         battle was a distracting and never-to-be-forgotten effort, but there was
         no help for it: no return, no shells; that was the War Office order. The
         ammunition still in hand lay mostly in the holds of the ships at <span class="location">Mudros</span>,
         60 miles away, and did not lend themselves to easy counting; while the
         actual expenditure was, for reasons already given, an intricate problem
         indeed.</p>
      
      
      <p>Continuous cables on the subject of ammunition passed during the next
         few days between G.H.Q. and the War Office, all of which passed through
         my hands and some of which I drafted for superior authority. I cannot
         remember their sequence and not always their purport, but I distinctly
         remember about the 10th or 11th May a cable being received from Lord
         Kitchener saying ammunition for Field Artillery was being pushed out
         via  Marseilles. I think the figures given were about ten or twenty
         thousand rounds of 18-pr. and some one thousand rounds of 4.5 howitzer
         H.E., but I am not sure.</p>
      
      
      <p>The fact that does remain indelibly impressed on my mind is that I am
         convinced from the cables that passed through my office that no
         provision had been made by the War Office to keep up a regular supply of
         artillery ammunition to the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> Expedition. The W.O. authority
         appeared to have given a bonus of ammunition when the Expedition sailed,
         and to have been somewhat taken aback and annoyed by the fact that a
         sure and continuous supply should afterwards be demanded.</p>
      
      
      <p>On 29th May I left G.H.Q. on appointment as Brigadier-General to command
         all the artillery at Cape <span class="location">Helles</span>, in which capacity I served till
         September, i.e. through all the big attacks and counter-attacks of June,
         July and August. In this capacity I was brought face to face with all
         the deficiencies in artillery  matériel  and ammunition, of which the
         following were the most important.</p>
      
      
      <p>Although there was only one Battery of 4.5 and one Battery of 6-in.
         howitzers at <span class="location">Helles</span> there was always an extreme deficiency of howitzer
         H.E. ammunition. So great was the shortage that immediately on taking up
         my command I found it necessary to issue a most stringent order that no
         howitzer on Cape <span class="location">Helles</span> was ever to fire H.E. without my personal
         authority. When the Turks attacked, 18-prs. and 15-prs. were to support
         the Infantry with shrapnel; howitzers were only to be used with my
         personal permission and then were only to fire shrapnel. All howitzer
         H.E. was to be used exclusively for supporting <span class="location">British</span> attacks by
         bombarding the <span class="location">Turkish</span> trenches before and during such activities.
         Throughout the above months, constant appeals were made to me by
         Infantry Commanders to bombard the <span class="location">Turkish</span> trenches with H.E. in order
         to retaliate for the loss our men had suffered from the <span class="location">Turkish</span> guns
         using H.E. Such requests I had invariably to refuse.</p>
      
      
      <p>There were fifty-six 18-prs. at <span class="location">Helles</span>, when I assumed command on the
         29th May, and subsequently they were increased to seventy-two at the end
         of July. Except for 640 rounds of H.E., which was fired off during the
         4th June battle, no more H.E. arrived till the end of July.</p>
      
      
      <p>Never during my command did the total number of rounds of 18-pr.
         ammunition at <span class="location">Helles</span> ever reach 25,000. Before one of our attacks, with
         very careful previous husbanding, the total used perhaps to reach 19,000
         to 23,000. The total amount I could therefore allot justifiably for the
         artillery preparation before an attack of our four <span class="location">British</span> Infantry
         Divisions never exceeded 12,000 rounds; as from 6,000 to 7,000 must
         necessarily be kept in reserve to assist in beating off the determined
         hostile counter-attacks. As I remarked at the beginning of this paper,
         artillery ammunition was a constant anxiety to the higher commanders on
         the Western Front also, but never, I believe, had Infantry to attack
         with so little artillery support as the above. My position in <span class="location">France</span> did
         not give me any inside knowledge of the details of artillery supply, but
         in one action at St. Eloi (near Ypres) on 14th or 15th February, in
         which only <span class="unit">27th Division</span> was concerned, the artillery of this Division
         (so the C.R.A. informed me) alone fired 10,000 18-pr. rounds in one
         night. At a similar action at the same place by the same division about
         a month later the divisional artillery fired, I believe, a slightly
         larger amount. Again, at Neuve Chapelle, in February, 1915, each
         Division had its own divisional artillery and the ammunition expenditure
         worked out to 150 rounds per 18-pr. gun. These official figures were
         shown me a few days after the battle by the G.O.C., 2nd Army.</p>
      
      
      <p>In comparing the ammunition expenditure of <span class="location">France</span> in 1915 and in the
         <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>, the enormous discrepancy in the number of 18-prs. per
         Division must be taken into account. Reckoning on the scale of the
         number of 18-prs. allotted to a <span class="location">British</span> Division in <span class="location">France</span>, we had at
         <span class="location">Helles</span> little more than sufficient 18-prs. for one Division, yet with
         this number we had to give artillery support to four Divisions. As to
         the French artillery at <span class="location">Helles</span>, they could always reckon on being able
         to expend 40,000 to 45,000 rounds when their two Divisions attacked.</p>
      
      
      <p>The complete absence of H.E. was severely felt, as shrapnel were of
         little use for destroying trenches, machine gun emplacements, etc.
         Therefore, in each and every <span class="location">British</span> attack, success was jeopardized and
         our infantry exposed to cruel losses, because, firstly, there was not
         sufficient ammunition to prepare their attack, and, secondly, there was
         no H.E. (except for howitzers) to destroy the machine guns in their
         emplacements. The latter, therefore, inflicted great losses on our
         Infantry in their advance.</p>
      
      
      <p>Our unfortunate position did not escape the notice of the French, who
         used at times generously to place under my command some of their field
         guns and howitzers, but in the latter they were also lamentably
         deficient, and in ammunition they were, themselves, during May and early
         June, none too well provided, although towards July their reserves grew
         more sufficient. The <span class="location">British</span> deficiency in ammunition, however, was so
         great, and created so much merriment among the French that they
         christened the <span class="location">British</span> Artillery, "Un coup par pièce"; with which term
         of endearment I was always personally greeted by the French Artillery
         General and his Staff, with all of whom I was great friends.</p>
      
      
      <p>At the battle of 28th June the French were unable to spare us the
         howitzers or ammunition we begged of them. The failure of the gallant
         <span class="unit">156th</span> Brigade of the <span class="unit">52nd Division</span> to take the H.12 trenches was
         essentially due to lack of artillery ammunition, especially of H.E.
         Allowing for losses that must have been suffered under any condition, I
         believe that some 700 or 800 Scottish casualties were due to this cause.
         Before the action the Corps Commander sent for me to say that he did not
         consider that enough guns and ammunition had been allotted to this
         portion of the <span class="location">Turkish</span> trenches. I replied that I agreed, but that there
         were no more available and that to reduce the bombardment of the
         hostile trenches on the left of our front would gravely prejudice the
         success of the <span class="unit">29th Division</span> in that quarter and that I understood
         success there was more vital than on our right flank. After consultation
         with the G.O.C. <span class="unit">29th Division</span>, the Corps Commander agreed with my
         allotment of the artillery. We then did our utmost to obtain the loan of
         more guns, howitzers or ammunition from the French without success and
         with the result that the attack was beaten off.</p>
      
      
      <p>So successful had been the attack on our left with its capture of five
         successive lines of <span class="location">Turkish</span> trenches that we had actually some
         ammunition to spare. In the afternoon it was agreed that there should be
         another attack on H.12, preceded by a very short but very intense
         bombardment from every gun and howitzer we possessed. All artillery
         arrangements for this were completed before 2.30 p.m., from which hour
         all the guns waited alert and ready for the Infantry to inform us of the
         hour they wished us to commence fire. I was in direct telephonic
         communication with the commander of the <span class="unit">52nd Division</span>, having had a
         private wire laid on to his Headquarters the previous day. Suddenly, to
         my horror, I received a telephone message from my Artillery Group
         Commander, Colonel Stockdale, saying the Infantry were making the
         assault and that he had no time to do more than fire half a dozen shots!</p>
      
      
      <p>In the attacks of 12th and 13th July, the French placed some thirty or
         forty guns and howitzers under <span class="location">British</span> command, and on account of the
         shortage of <span class="location">British</span> ammunition their guns undertook the whole of the
         artillery preparation, our artillery confining itself to covering fire
         during and after the Infantry advance. The counter-attacks were so
         violent and the calls for artillery support were so incessant that
         towards the afternoon of the 13th July the <span class="location">British</span> gun ammunition began
         to get alarmingly low, until finally only about 5,000 rounds of 18-pr.
         ammunition, including all rounds in Battery charge, remained at <span class="location">Helles</span>.
         The French were reluctant to supply further artillery support, fearing
         further attacks on themselves. This was the most anxious night I spent
         on the Peninsula--all but a limited number of rounds were withdrawn from
         most Batteries and were placed in horsed ammunition wagons, which
         perambulated from one side of the <span class="location">British</span> position to the other
         according to where it seemed most likely the next <span class="location">Turkish</span> attack would
         take place. These measures were successful and no Battery actually was
         left without one round at a critical moment, but the position throughout
         that night was a most dangerous one. Every hour a wire was sent to
         G.H.Q. giving expression to our crying needs, but there was next to
         nothing at <span class="location">Mudros</span>, while desperate fighting still went on without a
         minute's respite. At 11 p.m. that night a trawler did, to the joy of
         every gunner, reach <span class="location">Helles</span> with 3,000 rounds of 18-pr., but on the
         arrival of my Staff Officer to unload it, it was found that the fuses
         were of a new pattern never issued before and that the existing fuse
         keys would not adjust the fuses. As no new pattern fuse keys had been
         sent from home the Batteries had to manufacture their own, which was
         successfully accomplished after two days' delay.</p>
      
      
      <p>During June two Batteries, and during July two more Batteries of 5-inch
         howitzers, manned by Territorials, arrived at <span class="location">Helles</span>. During the last
         week of July the first two Batteries were sent to <span class="location">Anzac.</span> Some of these
         howitzers were very old and worn by corrosion, and were consequently
         inaccurate.</p>
      
      
      <p>The Gun History sheets of some of them showed they had been used at the
         Battle of Omdurman, seventeen years before, and had been in use ever
         since. After the big <span class="location">British</span> attacks of 6th and 7th August, their
         ammunition began to run short. On demand about 500 or 700 rounds were
         sent up from <span class="location">Mudros</span>--on arrival each shell was found to be of only 40
         lb. weight, whereas former shells were of 50 lb. weight. Their fuses
         were also of new pattern, which existing fuse keys would not fit and, to
         crown all, no range tables had been sent for this new pattern of shell.
         In spite of continual letters and telegrams to the War Office, when I
         left <span class="location">Helles</span> in September no new pattern fuse keys or range tables had
         ever arrived from <span class="location">England</span>; consequently these shells remained stacked on
         the Peninsula while the Batteries only fired occasionally for want of
         ammunition!</p>
      
      
      <p>On another occasion, when we were in the greatest straits for 15-pr.
         ammunition, many hundreds of rounds arrived at <span class="location">Helles</span>, which on being
         landed were discovered by my Staff only to be suitable for the Ehrhardt
         R.H.A. guns in <span class="location">Egypt</span>, no such guns being in the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>As for heavy artillery, practically speaking, there was none! Only one
         6-inch Howitzer Battery (4 howitzers) and one 60-pr. Battery (4 guns)
         were in action at <span class="location">Helles</span> up to July when four more guns of the latter
         calibre were landed. Unfortunately, however, the 60-prs. were of little
         use, as the recoil was too great for the carriages and the latter broke
         down beyond repair by our limited resources after very few rounds. At
         the beginning of August only one 60-pr. gun remained in action.
         Consequently, we had no heavy guns capable of replying to the <span class="location">Turkish</span>
         heavy guns which enveloped us on three sides, and from whose fire our
         infantry and artillery suffered severely.</p>
      
      
      <p>As to spare parts, spare guns and carriages, such luxuries were
         practically non-existent. No provision appears to have been made by the
         War Office to replace our guns or their parts, which became
         unserviceable through use or through damage by the hostile artillery. As
         the <span class="location">British</span> were holding the lower slopes of the <span class="location">Achi Baba</span> position, and
         as all our gun positions could be seen into by the Turks with powerful
         spectacles from their observation posts on the top of <span class="location">Achi Baba</span>, our
         equipment suffered severely. During June and July one 6-inch howitzer
         and twenty-five 18-prs. (out of a total of seventy-two) as well as one
         or two 60-prs., were put out of action by direct hits from the hostile
         artillery. Such guns were withdrawn to the field workshops on "W" Beach,
         but as these workshops were exposed to the enemy's artillery fire from
         three sides, the guns were often further damaged while under repair.
         Damaged guns had sometimes to wait for days in this workshop until other
         guns had been damaged in a different place by the hostile artillery.
         Then possibly one efficient gun could be made up of the undamaged
         portions of one, two or more guns. Batteries often, therefore, remained
         for days short of guns on account of the lack of spare parts.</p>
      
      
      <p>When I assumed command of the artillery at <span class="location">Helles</span>, there were two
         Batteries of mountain guns (10-prs.) in action, but they were of a
         prehistoric pattern. In 1899 the Khedive of <span class="location">Egypt</span> possessed in his Army,
         in which I was then serving, mountain guns which were more up-to-date in
         every respect. So inaccurate were these 10-prs. that they had to be
         placed close behind the front trenches lest they should hit our own
         Infantry, the result being a very heavy casualty list in officers and
         men amongst their Territorial personnel. Many of these lives could have
         been saved, had reasonable modern weapons been supplied. These obsolete
         old guns wore out so quickly that the two Batteries quickly melted into
         one Battery, and when they finally left <span class="location">Helles</span> for Anzac at the end of
         July, I believe only 3 guns and their detachments were left in being.</p>
      
      
      <p>As for anti-aircraft guns, they did not exist at all and the hostile
         aeroplanes used to fly over and drop bombs  ad lib.  without fear of
         molestation, the only saving clause being that the enemy appeared to
         possess almost as few aeroplanes as the <span class="location">British</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>In no point of their equipment did the force at <span class="location">Helles</span> suffer so much in
         comparison with their comrades in <span class="location">France</span> as in the matter of aeroplanes
         which, at the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>, were hopelessly deficient not only in the
         numbers but also in quality. There were not sufficient pilots and there
         were no observers at all. Brave and efficient as the naval pilots were,
         they could not be expected to be of any use as artillery spotters unless
         they had been thoroughly trained for this important duty. This
         deficiency had to be made good at all costs by drafting young artillery
         subalterns from their Batteries and sending them to the Air Force, where
         their lack of training and experience in operation was at first severely
         felt, although later these lads did magnificent work. Thus Batteries
         were deprived of their trained subalterns just at the moment when the
         latter were most required on account of the severe casualties suffered
         in the landing and during the subsequent early operations. But few of
         the aeroplanes were fitted with wireless and the receivers on the ground
         could not take in messages over a distance longer than 5,000 yards.
         Consequently, each aeroplane had to return within this radius of the
         receiver, before its observation could be delivered, thus immensely
         curtailing the usefulness and efficiency of the aeroplane observation.
         Owing to the above conditions, aeroplanes could only be used for the
         counter-batteries firing on hostile artillery.</p>
      
      
      <p>As regards trench mortars, the supply was hopelessly inadequate. I
         cannot give the exact figures, but I believe there were not a dozen at
         <span class="location">Helles</span> during the whole period I was there, and these were of such an
         indifferent type as to be practically useless, and for this reason no
         one bothered about them. No provision appears to have been made for the
         supply of such necessities of trench warfare by the Home Authorities.
         This appears to be indefensible, as I believe very early in the
         operations their provision was specially asked for by G.H.Q. The
         absolute failure to supply such articles of vital necessity eventually
         led to the French C.-in-C. at <span class="location">Helles</span> lending the <span class="location">British</span> two demizel
         trench mortars and large quantities of ammunition. These were manned by
         artillery detachments, and by their magnificent work and the constant
         demand from the Infantry for their services, it was conclusively proved
         what an invaluable aid a sufficient supply of these weapons would have
         been.</p>
      
      
      <p>From the very first it was apparent to me that the number of <span class="location">British</span>
         guns at <span class="location">Helles</span> was not sufficient to prepare and support simultaneous
         Infantry attacks of the whole <span class="location">British</span> Force at this end of the
         Peninsula. In June I drew up a memorandum to G.H.Q. pointing this out
         and asking for a big increase of guns, howitzers and ammunition. What
         happened to this I cannot say. I only know that the guns and ammunition
         asked for never materialized.</p>
      
      
      <p>The whole story of the artillery at <span class="location">Helles</span> may be summed up in the
         following sentences: insufficiency of guns of every nature;
         insufficiency of ammunition of every nature, especially of H.E.;
         insufficient provision made by the Home Authorities for spare guns,
         spare carriages, spare parts, adequate repairing workshops, or for a
         regular daily, weekly or monthly supply of ammunition; guns provided
         often of an obsolete pattern and so badly worn by previous use as to be
         most inaccurate; lack of aeroplanes, trained observers and of all the
         requisites for air observation; total failure to produce the trench
         mortars and bombs to which the closeness of the opposing lines at <span class="location">Helles</span>
         would have lent themselves well--in short, total lack of organization at
         home to provide even the most rudimentary and indispensable artillery
         requisites for daily consumption; not to speak of downright carelessness
         which resulted in wrong shells being sent to the wrong guns, and new
         types of fuses being sent without fuse keys and new types of howitzer
         shells without range tables. These serious faults provoked their own
         penalties in the shape of the heavy losses suffered by our Infantry and
         artillery, which might have been to a great measure averted if
         sufficient forethought and attention had been devoted to the "side-show"
         at the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>After commanding the starved artillery at <span class="location">Helles</span> it was my good fortune
         to command the artillery of the 21st Army Corps at the third Battle of
         Gaza, in November, 1917, and also at the great Battle of 19th
         September, 1918, in which the Turks in Palestine were finally crushed,
         and I think it may add emphasis to what I have said if I contrast the
         artillery support of the two campaigns and show the results which
         ensued. On the night before the third Battle of Gaza, the artillery
         under my command (to support three Divisions) consisted of the
         following, viz.:--19-1/2 Batteries (i.e., 78 guns and howitzers) of
         heavy artillery, comprising 8-inch howitzers, 6-inch guns, 6-inch
         howitzers and 60-pr. guns--all of the most modern and up-to-date type.</p>
      
      
      <p>The Field Artillery comprised 108 18-prs. and 36 4.5 howitzers while in
         addition there were 8 modern mountain howitzers and guns. There was not
         an artillery weapon in the whole Army Corps that was not efficient and
         up-to-date, while immediately behind the front line existed perfectly
         organized workshops capable of executing any repairs. There was ample
         provision of spare guns, carriages and parts, and an abundance of trench
         mortars which, though they would have changed the whole face of the
         Peninsula conflict, could not be used in Palestine owing to the breadth
         of No Man's Land. Ammunition for every nature of gun and howitzer was
         pressed upon us in profusion--over a thousand rounds per gun was buried
         and concealed near every Battery, while immediately behind the fighting
         line huge reserves were available for immediate use if required. At the
         advanced railhead, G.H.Q. literally built mountains of ammunition as a
         further supply; all this in addition to vast quantities stored in depôts
         in <span class="location">Egypt</span> and on the banks of the Suez Canal. So great was the
         superabundance of shell, that hundreds of tons were left lying on the
         ground after the nine days' Battle at Gaza; which it took months to
         remove. At the battle of the 19th September, 1918, in Palestine
         conditions were exactly the same. There was an absolute  embarras de
         richesse  of every artillery requisite. This wealth of artillery
         material was supported in Palestine by a full complement of artillery,
         aeroplanes, pilots and observers, the latter being all thoroughly
         trained and efficient. In addition, by a sufficiency of fighting
         aeroplanes with most efficient pilots, our artillery were adequately
         guarded from sunrise to sunset from any hostile aeroplane observation.</p>
      
      
      <p>In short, our air supremacy was undisputed and absolutely protected our
         own artillery against damage and molestation from the hostile guns. On
         the other hand, the enemy's artillery lay at our mercy directly their
         gun positions were discovered.</p>
      
      
      <p>The whole science of artillery and aeroplane co-operation had, of
         course, been vastly extended and perfected since <span class="location">Gallipoli</span> days, but the
         point I wish to make is this: that in 1917 and 1918 the Palestine Front
         was fitted out on the same scale, proportionately, as the Western Front;
         whereas in 1915 this was not the case in the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> as regards
         artillery, for instance, only one Division (the 29th) at <span class="location">Helles</span> having
         18-pr. guns and the<span class="unit">Naval Division</span> having been given no artillery at
         all!</p>
      
      
      <p>To put the matter shortly, whereas at <span class="location">Helles</span> I had under my command no
         more than 88 to 95 guns and howitzers of all natures with scarcely any
         ammunition or aeroplanes to support four <span class="location">British</span> Divisions; in Palestine
         at Gaza I had at least 230 guns and howitzers (one-third of which were
         of heavy calibre) with an abundance of ammunition and a sufficiency of
         aeroplanes to support the attack of one and a half Divisions, the
         remaining one and a half Divisions at Gaza being in reserve. At the
         battle of 19th September, 1918, in Palestine I had, to the best of my
         recollection, about 360 guns of all calibres to support four Divisions.
         The terrible casualties suffered by our Infantry at <span class="location">Helles</span> are well
         known, and my feelings as Artillery Commander unable to give them
         anything like the support they would have had in <span class="location">France</span> or Flanders may
         be guessed. But this was made up to me afterwards when I commanded the
         artillery at Gaza, that strong fortress which was captured by the 21st
         Army Corps, with certainly under 3,000 casualties and I believe with
         under 2,000 killed and wounded. At Gaza the Turks were simply crushed by
         our overwhelming artillery, fed from inexhaustible Ordnance parks and
         dumps. Before the Infantry attack commenced the position was subjected
         to a continuous bombardment night and day for six days and six nights
         from every available gun and howitzer. The Infantry then attacked and
         took a large portion of the position with a loss of, I believe, under
         1,000 men. The Turks counter-attacked, but they melted away under the
         tremendous artillery barrage and never attempted another during this
         battle. Next night our Infantry tried to extend their conquest but the
         Turks had meanwhile brought up an old <span class="location">Gallipoli</span> Division, the 7th, which
         held them at bay and inflicted upon them serious losses which, I
         believe, increased their casualties to between two and three thousand.
         The Corps Commander then decided to let the Infantry stand where they
         were, to submit the Turks to a further three days' and three nights'
         bombardment, at the end of which our Infantry advanced again only to
         find that the Turks were evacuating the whole of the Gaza position.
         After the Battle of 19th September, 1918, many Infantry commanders of
         Divisions, Brigades and Battalions have told me the Turks appeared
         crushed by the terrific artillery bombardment (under cover of which our
         men advanced) and offered a resistance which, in comparison with our
         experiences of <span class="location">Gallipoli</span>, can only be called feeble.</p>
      
      
      <p>The cardinal fact that remains in my mind is that in Palestine the 21st
         Army Corps always had enough (and more than enough) of every artillery
         requisite for whatever number of Divisions the Army Corps was composed
         of; whereas, in <span class="location">Gallipoli</span>, the VIIIth Army Corps at <span class="location">Helles</span>, which was
         composed of four <span class="location">British</span> Divisions, never had enough Field Artillery or
         ammunition to support more than one Division, and never possessed
         sufficient heavy artillery to support more than one Infantry Brigade.</p>
      
      
      <p>The material part of my statement ends here, and it only remains for me
         to remind you that all the grievous shortcomings I have exposed were
         actually made good by the heroism, devotion and sufferings of the
         Officers and men of the Artillery at <span class="location">Helles</span>, both Regular, Territorial,
         <span class="location">Australia</span> and <span class="location">New Zealand</span>. Rest was impossible, as no Battery could
         ever be withdrawn from the line and all field Batteries were under rifle
         fire. If placed outside that range, they were destroyed by flanking fire
         from <span class="location">Turkish</span> guns in Asia. No dug-outs were possible, as dug-outs were
         understood in <span class="location">France</span>, as there was no timber or roofing for their
         construction. All ranks were thus exposed night and day to continuous
         fire, and were sometimes killed as they slept in their valises by stray
         bullets, thousands of which were fired unaimed every night by the Turks
         in the hopes of inflicting casualties; water for drinking and washing
         was almost as precious as guns and shells. The joys of a canteen, as was
         at that time supplied by the War Office to our Army in <span class="location">France</span>, were
         unknown; bare rations washed down by a limited allowance of water were
         our only form of food; everyone suffered more or less from dysentery,
         spread by the millions of flies which settled on every mouthful we ate
         and made life almost insupportable by day. No Man's Land was one vast
         litter of unburied corpses. Yet no man's spirit ever wavered and all
         ranks remained as bright, as hopeful and as cheerful as on the day of
         the first great landing. If shells were scarce, complaints were
         non-existent; all were upheld by the wonderful religion of
         self-sacrifice. It will ever remain my greatest pride that I had the
         astonishing good fortune to be associated with such a body of officers
         and men; to them I owe a debt of gratitude that is beyond redemption,
         and to them alone is due the credit for any success which the artillery
         at <span class="location">Helles</span> may have attained in what was one of <span class="location">England</span>'s greatest
         tragedies, but was also one of <span class="location">England</span>'s greatest glories.</p>

      <p>     NOTES BY LIEUT.-COLONEL CHARLES ROSENTHAL,[17] COMMANDING 3RD
         AUSTRALIAN FIELD ARTILLERY BRIGADE, 1ST AUSTRALIAN DIVISION,
         RELATING TO ARTILLERY AT ANZAC, FROM 25TH APRIL TO 25TH AUGUST,
         1915. ( Compiled from personal diary. )</p>
      
      
      
      <p>During the early hours of 25th April, 1915, the 3rd <span class="location">Australia</span> Infantry
         Brigade landed on <span class="location">Gallipoli</span> Peninsula, close to Gaba Tepe, at a point
         now known as Anzac Beach, followed by other troops of 1st <span class="location">Australia</span>
         Division and <span class="location">Australia</span> and <span class="location">New Zealand</span> Division.</p>
      
      
      <p>Arrangements had been made for artillery to land about 10 a.m. on the
         same morning, but owing to delays in disembarkation of Infantry, and
         enemy shelling of transports necessitating ships temporarily leaving
         their allotted anchorage, it was after mid-day before the vessels
         carrying guns were actually in correct position for disembarkation.</p>
      
      
      <p>I did not wait for the naval boats to come alongside, but after issuing
         necessary instructions to Battery Commanders concerning the landing of
         the guns, I disembarked in a ship's boat manned by a volunteer crew from
         my Brigade Ammunition Column, accompanied by two officers and sixteen
         men of my Headquarters' Staff.</p>
      
      
      <p>Immediately on landing I reported to my C.R.A., and was by him informed
         that the Divisional Commander had decided no artillery should land
         during the day. This decision absolutely nonplussed me, and on asking
         the reason I was informed the position was not considered sufficiently
         secure to ensure the safety of guns, if emplaced. With this decision I
         did not agree and urged, without result, that the safety of guns was
         surely secondary to the proper supporting of the troops already
         committed.</p>
      
      
      <p>In view of the above decision instructions were at once sent off to the
         ships ordering Colonel Johnstone, Commanding 2nd A.F.A. Brigade, and
         Major Hughes, acting for me in command of 3rd A.F.A. Brigade, to defer
         disembarkation of guns. Colonel Johnstone, however, by this time had one
         18-pr. gun well on the way to the shore. Permission was given for it to
         be landed and it was brought into action close to the beach against guns
         at Gaba Tepe, undoubtedly temporarily silencing them.</p>
      
      
      <p>In the meantime the Indian Mountain Battery attached to <span class="unit">1st Australia
            Division</span>, which had landed early in the day, was in action doing
         splendid work though suffering severe casualties.</p>
      
      
      <p>By the order of Colonel White, G.S.O. (1), 1st <span class="location">Australia</span> Division, I
         spent the afternoon in collecting Infantry stragglers and getting them
         forward again to the firing line. At 5 p.m. I reported completion of
         this task and then proceeded to thoroughly reconnoitre the right flank,
         overlooking Gaba Tepe, which had seemed to me, from observations made
         from the ship, to be a suitable area for emplacing of guns.</p>
      
      
      <p>I returned to Divisional Headquarters just before dark, and informed the
         C.R.A. and Divisional Commander that I had found suitable places for
         batteries and could use them effectively.</p>
      
      
      <p>I had in my reconnaissance conferred with three Battalion Commanders
         (one of whom was killed a couple of days later), who were delighted to
         hear that the artillery they were so anxiously waiting for was to come
         up in support.</p>
      
      
      <p>After much discussion and persuasion the Divisional Commander agreed to
         allow me to land two of my three 18-pr. batteries. This approval was
         shortly afterwards altered to permission to land two guns only, and
         finally all approval was cancelled, though no information of these
         decisions officially reached me.</p>
      
      
      <p>During the night, in anticipation of early arrival of guns, my
         Headquarters personnel worked untiringly in preparing a track from the
         beach to the selected sites for guns, and it was not till 5.30 a.m. on
         26th that I learned approval to land guns had been cancelled overnight.</p>
      
      
      <p>During the morning of 26th April one gun of 1st Battery, 1st Brigade,
         and one gun of 4th Battery, 2nd Brigade, were landed, hauled up the
         steep hill to their positions, and came into action on the extreme right
         of ridge overlooking Gaba Tepe.</p>
      
      
      <p>Later in the day the 7th Battery of my Brigade came into action on the
         same ridge and the single guns of 1st and 4th Batteries were withdrawn
         for return to their respective Brigades.</p>
      
      
      <p>During the afternoon there also came ashore, apparently without order,
         two guns of 3rd Battery, 1st Brigade, and 8th Battery, 3rd Brigade, but
         were returned to their respective ships by the C.R.A.</p>
      
      
      <p>My guns were placed absolutely in the Infantry front trenches, on the
         sky line, no troops of any kind being in advance of them. It would have
         been quite useless to take up positions behind the Infantry line in the
         normal way, owing to the configuration of the ground, for in such cases
         the lowest range at which the crest could be cleared was 3,000 yards,
         while our targets were from 500 to 1,000 yards distant. Indeed at night,
         shrapnel shell with fuse set at zero was frequently used.</p>
      
      
      <p>Each gun fired during the 26th about 400 rounds, over open sights, and
         caused very heavy casualties to the enemy.</p>
      
      
      <p>The whole battery covered a front of 187°, necessitating each gun being
         personally controlled by an officer and each with its own particular arc
         of fire.</p>
      
      
      <p>The supply of ammunition was very difficult. It had to be delivered by
         hand to the guns over a bullet-swept area, the distance from the beach
         to the guns being about half a mile, while in this distance the hills
         rose 400 feet.</p>
      
      
      <p>By the afternoon of the 3rd May, two guns of 8th Battery, 3rd Brigade,
         were in action, and 2nd Brigade also had guns in position on the left
         flank of 1st <span class="location">Australia</span> Divisional Front.</p>
      
      
      <p>The <span class="location">Australia</span> and <span class="location">New Zealand</span> Division also had 18-prs. in action
         together with two 4.5-inch Howitzer Batteries, the latter being the only
         howitzers available up to this time at Anzac.</p>
      
      
      <p>I was wounded on 5th May, evacuated to Cairo, and did not rejoin my
         command at Anzac till 26th May. During this interval gun positions, as
         well as Infantry trenches, had been much improved, and the enemy country
         in our immediate front which, when I left on 5th May, gave no signs of
         life, was now well traversed by trenches.</p>
      
      
      <p>I found in my sector that the guns of my Brigade were now all in action,
         and the remainder of the artillery of the Division was also emplaced.</p>
      
      
      <p>About this time 6-inch howitzers were made available and later emplaced,
         one for left sector, one for the centre, and one for the right, but with
         very limited quantities of ammunition. Another 6-inch howitzer was
         landed on 17th June.</p>
      
      
      <p>I had made continual urgent representations for two 4.7-inch guns for
         right flank to deal with innumerable targets beyond the range of
         18-prs., but it was not till 11th July that one very old and much worn
         gun arrived, and was placed in position on right flank, firing its first
         round on 26th July.</p>
      
      
      <p>On 24th June a Scottish Territorial Howitzer Battery (the 5th Battery,
         City of Glasgow Lowland Howitzer Brigade) arrived and came under my
         command.</p>
      
      
      <p>On 14th July a heavy battery was organized for right flank, consisting
         of the two 6-inch howitzers and the 4.7-inch gun before mentioned, but
         ammunition was still very scarce.</p>
      
      
      <p>On 15th July a 5-inch Howitzer Brigade under Colonel Hope Johnstone
         commenced to arrive and was complete in position by 18th July.</p>
      
      
      <p>On 28th July the 4th Battery of Lowland Brigade arrived.</p>
      
      
      <p>About this time some alterations were made in artillery dispositions and
         grouping in preparation for impending battle at <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay and Lone Pine,
         commencing on 6th August, and on 30th July the artillery of right sector
         under my command was as follows:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  3rd A.F.A. Brigade (18-prs.).
         Heavy Battery (two 6-inch howitzers and one 4.7-inch gun).
         2 Mountain Guns.
         Two 5-inch Howitzer Batteries, Lowland Brigade.
         One 5-inch Howitzer Battery, 69th Brigade.</p>
      
      
      <p>When leaving <span class="location">Australia</span> in 1914 I had urged that a battery of 5-inch
         howitzers (which I commanded prior to the outbreak of war), together
         with stocks of ammunition held by <span class="location">Australia</span>, should accompany 1st
         <span class="location">Australia</span> Division. This was not approved. On arrival at <span class="location">Gallipoli</span>
         Peninsula, when the need for howitzers was at once apparent, I again
         re-opened the question, particularly on the 29th May, when the C.R.A.
         agreed to press for them to be sent forward. The Divisional Commander,
         on 25th June, cabled <span class="location">Australia</span> definitely asking for this battery, which
         was at once forwarded, but arrived at the Peninsula too late to be of
         any service.</p>
      
      
      <p>Two <span class="location">Australia</span> Field Batteries (together with a Brigade of Infantry)
         were transferred to Cape <span class="location">Helles</span> on 5th May and did not rejoin the
         <span class="location">Australia</span> Division at Anzac till 18th August.</p>
      
      
      <p>With the limited number of guns available it was exceedingly important
         that transfers might be made very rapidly from one part of our front to
         another, and on 2nd June I put forward a proposal which was approved
         immediately to make a road along the entire front just behind the crest
         on which infantry trenches were sited. This road was completed in about
         two weeks and was a great boon alike to gunners and Infantry.</p>
      
      
      <p>Up to 24th August no anti-aircraft guns had been provided, but specially
         constructed emplacements had been made for 18-prs. to be used against
         aircraft, and though never successful in bringing down an enemy 'plane
         they certainly made good enough shooting to cause enemy aviators to
         treat them with respect. About 20th August three 3-pr. Hotchkiss arrived
         for anti-aircraft purposes. They were of obsolete pattern and had been
         manufactured for the Japanese Government many years before. In fact the
         only range tables provided were printed in Japanese, but thanks to the
         fact that one of my Sergeants (who was a Master Mariner) spoke Japanese,
         we succeeded in preparing serviceable range tables.</p>
      
      
      <p>Two Japanese trench mortars were also used from Infantry trenches with
         excellent effect, but owing to ammunition supply becoming soon exhausted
         and no fresh supplies being available they had to be discarded. A good
         supply of these weapons, together with full supplies of ammunition,
         would have been invaluable in bombarding enemy front line trenches.</p>
      
      
      <p>The ammunition supply at all times up to the operation of 6th August was
         a difficult problem. Frequently we had to be rationed to a very small
         allowance per battery per day, and the guns of the heavy battery were
         for some time not permitted to fire more than two rounds per day and
         then only by special permission of the C.R.A.</p>
      
      
      <p>On 20th June I was first informed that H.E. for 18-pr. was to be
         supplied, and shortly afterwards a small supply for experiment was
         landed at Anzac. I think I am right in saying my share was 15 rounds per
         battery.</p>
      
      
      <p>On 2nd August our first supply of H.E. arrived, but only 150 rounds per
         battery.</p>
      
      
      <p>During the first few months of the campaign, when our stocks of
         ammunition were desperately low, our guns and gunners had to suffer
         considerable casualties without being able to effectively reply.</p>
      
      
      <p>Our batteries were of necessity in many cases under direct observation
         of the enemy, and only the splendid work of the detachments in building

      <p>Under the protection of the banks of a small ravine near the beach, our

         skill displayed in the repairing and replacing of damaged guns earned
         for the artificers our most grateful appreciation and thanks.</p>

      <p>APPENDIX III</p>
      
      
      
      <p>The Dispatch of a Commander-in-Chief is not a technical document. In it
         the situation should be set forth, as briefly and clearly as may be,
         together with a few words indicative of the plan of G.H.Q. for coping
         with it. After that comes a narrative which ends with thanks to those
         individuals and units who have earned them. A Dispatch should be so
         written that civilians can follow the facts stated without trouble: it
         should not be too technical. But when the Military Colleges and
         Academies at Camberley, Duntroon, Kingston, West Point and in the
         European and Japanese capitals set to work in a scientific spirit to
         apportion praise or blame they are more influenced by the actual
         instructions and orders issued by the Commander-in-Chief  before and
         during the battle , than by any after-the-event stories of what
         happened. They are glad to know the intentions of the Commander, but his
         instructions i.e., the actual steps he took to give practical effect to
         those intentions, are what really interest them.</p>
      
      
      <p>When I came to write my Dispatch of the 11th December, so much about the
         actual course of events at <span class="location">Suvla</span> was still obscure, that it had become
         desirable either to write the narrative in a more technical form than
         was customary or else to publish my actual instructions simultaneously
         with the Dispatch. I chose the latter course. The authorities had raised
         objections to several passages in the Dispatch, and in every case but
         one, where they had wished me to add something which was not, in my
         opinion, correct, I had met them. No objection had been raised to the
         inclusion of my instructions. At 9 p.m. on the night of the 6th January
         (the Dispatch being due to appear next morning) I received a letter by
         Special Messenger from the War Office telling me the Press Bureau were
         wiring to all those to whom the Dispatch had been issued to suppress the
         instructions!</p>
      
      
      <p>Whatever the reason of this action may have been, its result was clear
         enough: my Dispatch was eviscerated at the very moment it was stepping
         on to the platform. Had I known that these instructions, now given, were
         to have been cut out, my Dispatch would have been differently written.</p>

      <p>SIR IAN HAMILTON'S INSTRUCTIONS.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>  TO VICE-ADMIRAL, COMMANDING
         EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN SQUADRON,</p>
      
      
      <p>                                                 17th July, 1915. </p>
      
      
      <p>SIR,--I have the honour to forward a series of tables drawn up to show
         in detail the men, animals, vehicles, stores, etc., which it will be
         required to land in connection with the forthcoming operations. I shall
         be grateful if you will let me know as early as possible if you consider
         that any part of the programme indicated presents especially serious
         difficulties or is likely to require modification.</p>
      
      
      <p>In informing me of the results of your consideration, I shall be obliged
         if you will let me know what craft you intend to use in carrying out the
         disembarkations referred to in tables B, C, D and E, so that detailed
         arrangements with regard to embarkation and to the allocation of troops,
         etc., to boats may be prepared.</p>
      
      
      <p>2. Immediately after the disembarkation of the details referred to in
         the attached tables it will be necessary, if the operations are
         successful, to land 5,000 to 7,000 horses in order to render the force
         sufficiently mobile to carry the operations to a conclusion. Details as
         to disembarkation of these horses will be forwarded to you later. In the
         meantime the horses will be collected at <span class="location">Alexandria</span>, and should
         subsequently be brought up to <span class="location">Mudros</span> or <span class="location">Imbros</span>, to begin arriving on
         August 6th.</p>
      
      
      <p>It will also be necessary to land the remaining portions of the units
         referred to in the tables (first line transport, etc.), and, further,
         the remaining units of the formations to which they belong. In this
         latter category will be included three batteries of heavy artillery with
         mechanical transport. It will not be required to land any of the above
         until after August 7th, and details as to numbers, order of
         disembarkation, etc., will be forwarded to you later.</p>
      
      
      <p>                    I have the honour to be, Sir,
         Your obedient Servant,
         ( Signed ) IAN HAMILTON,</p>

      <p>  GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING,</p>
      
      
      <p>  AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND ARMY CORPS.</p>
      
      
      <p>With reference to your G.288 of 15th July, the Navy is being asked to
         provide transport for the following ammunition to be landed at Anzac by
         the 3rd August:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p> For A. and N.Z.A.C. --Sufficient S.A.A. to bring the amount on shore up
         to 500 rounds per rifle and 27,500 per machine-gun.</p>
      
      
      <p> For other Troops. --300 rounds per rifle and 24,000 rounds per
         machine-gun (in addition to what the troops will carry on landing).</p>
      
      
      <p>These will come to 10,000,000 rounds in all, and arrangements are being
         made to begin landing this ammunition as soon as possible.</p>
      
      
      <p>2. The following artillery ammunition will also have to be gradually
         landed and stored, and should all be ashore, if possible, by August
         3rd:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  10 pr.                                  5,700 rounds
         18 pr. (probably 15 per cent. H.E.)    15,500 "
         4.5-in. Howitzer probably half H.E.     1,600 "
         5-in. Howitzer majority H.E.           10,000 "
         6-in. Howitzer majority H.E.            1,200 "
         60 pr. probably two-thirds H.E.         1,000 "</p>
      
      
      <p>All of this ammunition is not yet arrived, and the proportion of H.E.
         shell is not yet ascertainable from <span class="location">England</span>. The arrangements suggested
         in your paragraph 2 (iii.) of your letter are noted, and will be
         followed as far as possible.</p>
      
      
      <p>3. With regard to the marking of ammunition-boxes, the necessary
         arrangements are being prepared. You will be informed of the
         arrangements and of the system of marking in due course.</p>
      
      
      <p>Consignments of Mark VI. and Mark VII. will be sent separately as you
         suggest.</p>
      
      
      <p>4. The above figures do not include the periodical replenishment
         referred to in paragraph 2 (iv.) of your letter. Dispatch of
         consignments on this account and consignments for the reserve will be
         notified to you separately.</p>
      
      
      <p>                                    ( Signed ) W. P. BRAITHWAITE,</p>
      
      
      <p>                                           Major-General, C.G.S., 
         Mediterranean Expeditionary Force. </p>
      
      
      <p>Enclosed a copy of tables forwarded to Vice-Admiral, showing troops,
         animals, stores, etc., which the Navy is being asked to land at Anzac.</p>
      
      
      <p>                                                22nd July, 1915. </p>
      
      
      <p>  GENERAL OFFICES COMMANDING,
         9TH CORPS.</p>
      
      
      <p>The General Commanding wishes me to send you the following outline of
         his plans for the next general attack, for the exclusive information of
         yourself, your Divisional Generals, and such Officers of your Corps
         Headquarters and Divisional Headquarters as you may consider it
         necessary to take into your confidence. I am to add that it is Sir Ian's
         wish that as few officers as possible should be made acquainted with it.</p>
      
      
      <p>2. The general plan is, while holding as many of the enemy as possible
         in the southern theatre, to throw the weight of our attack on the
         <span class="location">Turkish</span> forces now opposite the <span class="location">Australia</span> and <span class="location">New Zealand</span> Army Corps.
         It is hoped, by means of an attack on the front and right flank of these
         forces, to deal them a crushing blow, and to drive the remnants south
         towards Kilid Bahr. It will then be the object of the General Commanding
         to seize a position across the peninsula from Gaba Tepe to Maidos with a
         protected line of supply from <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay.</p>
      
      
      <p>3. The strength of the enemy north of Kilid Bahr at the present time is
         about 30,000 men. Of these some 12,000 are permanently maintained in the
         trenches opposite the Anzac position, and the majority of the remainder
         are held in reserve at Boghali, Kojadere and Eski-Keui. It is believed
         that there are about three battalions in the Anafarta villages, a
         battalion at Ismail Oglu Tepe (New map 1/20,000), a battalion near
         Yilghin Burnu, and small parties of outposts at Lala Baba (Sq. 104.L.)
         and Ghazi Baba (Sq. 106.N.). The hills due east of <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay towards Aji
         Liman are believed to be held only by a few Gendarmerie, but
         information on this point is at present not precise. The hills near
         Yilghin Burnu and Ismail Oglu Tepe are known to contain one 4.7-in. gun,
         one 9.2-in. gun, and three field guns, protected by wire entanglements
         and infantry trenches, but it is believed that the main defences are
         against attack from the south or west, and that there is no wire on the
         northern slopes of the hills; also that the guns can only be fired in a
         southerly direction.</p>
      
      
      <p>4. The success of the plan outlined in paragraph 2 will depend on two
         main factors:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  (a) The capture of Hill 305 (Sq. 93.W.).</p>
      
      
      <p>  (b) The capture and retention of <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay as a base
         of operations for the northern army.</p>
      
      
      <p>5. The operations from within the present Anzac position against the
         enemy on Hill 305 will be carried out by the <span class="location">Australia</span> and <span class="location">New Zealand</span>
         Corps, temporarily reinforced by the following units of the 9th Army
         Corps:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  <span class="unit">13th Division</span> (less 66th, 67th and 68th Brigades, R.F.A.).</p>
      
      
      <p>  29th Infantry Brigade (10th Division).</p>
      
      
      <p>  29th <span class="location">Indian</span> Brigade.</p>
      
      
      <p>  69th Howitzer Brigade, R.F.A.</p>
      
      
      <p>6. The landing near <span class="location">Suvla</span> will be entrusted to you, and you will have at
         your disposal:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  11th Division.</p>
      
      
      <p>  10th Division (less 29th Brigade).</p>
      
      
      <p>  Highland Mountain Artillery Brigade.</p>
      
      
      <p>  1st/4th Lowland Howitzer Brigade.</p>
      
      
      <p>The disembarkation of your command, which may be expected to be opposed,
         though not in great strength, will be after dark at a point immediately
         south of Lala Baba. The first troops to disembark will be the 11th
         Division, which will have been concentrated at <span class="location">Imbros</span> previously to the
         attack, and will be brought across under cover of darkness in destroyers
         and motor-lighters. It is expected that approximately 4,000 men will be
         disembarked simultaneously, and that three infantry brigades and the
         mountain artillery brigade will be ashore before daylight.</p>
      
      
      <p>Your first objectives will be the high ground at Lala Baba and Ghazi
         Baba, and the hills near Yilghin Burnu and Ismail Oglu Tepe. It will
         also be necessary to send a small force to secure a footing on the hills
         due east of <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay. It is of first importance that Yilghin Burnu and
         Ismail Oglu Tepe should be captured by a coup-de-main before daylight in
         order to prevent the guns which they contain being used against our
         troops on Hill 305 and to safeguard our hold on <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay. It is hoped
         that one division will be sufficient for the attainment of these
         objectives.</p>
      
      
      <p>Your subsequent moves will depend on circumstances which cannot at
         present be gauged, but it is hoped that the remainder of your force will
         be available on the morning of the 7th August to advance on Biyuk
         Anafarta with the object of moving up the eastern spurs of Hill 305 so
         as to assist General Birdwood's attack.</p>
      
      
      <p>7. The operations from within the present Anzac position will begin
         during the day immediately preceding your disembarkation (the
         reinforcements for General Birdwood's force having been dribbled ashore
         in detachments at Anzac Cove on the three previous nights). The
         operations will begin with a determined attack on the <span class="location">Turkish</span> left
         centre, Lonesome Pine and Johnston's Jolly (see enlarged map of Anzac
         position), with the object of attracting the enemy's reserves to this
         portion of the line. The Turks have for long been apprehensive of our
         landing in the neighbourhood of Gaba Tepe, and it is hoped that an
         attack in force in this quarter will confirm their apprehensions. At
         nightfall the <span class="location">Turkish</span> outposts on the extreme right of the enemy's line
         will be rushed, and a force of 20,000 men will advance in three or more
         columns up the ravines running down from Chunuk Bair. This advance,
         which will begin about the same time as your first troops reach the
         shore, will be so timed as to reach the summit of the main ridge near
         Chunuk Bair about 2.30 a.m. (soon after moon-rise).</p>
      
      
      <p>Latest photographs show that the <span class="location">Turkish</span> trenches on this ridge do not
         extend further north than Chunuk Bair, and it is unlikely that the
         higher portions of the ridge are held in great strength.</p>
      
      
      <p>As soon as a lodgement has been effected on this ridge a portion of the
         attacking force will be left to consolidate the position gained and the
         remainder will advance south-west against the enemy's trenches near Baby
         700, which will be attacked simultaneously by a special detachment from
         within the Anzac position.</p>
      
      
      <p>An advance by your force from the east will, as already indicated in
         paragraph 6, be of great assistance in the event of this attack being
         checked.</p>
      
      
      <p>8. The landing of sufficient transport to secure the mobility of your
         force will be a matter of considerable difficulty. No animals or
         vehicles of any kind will be able to land in the first instance, and
         machine-guns, tools and necessary medical and signalling equipment must
         be carried by hand. All men will land with two iron rations (one day's
         meat ration only is advised); infantry will carry 200 rounds S.A.A. and
         machine-gun sections 3,500 rounds in belt boxes. Packs and greatcoats
         will not be taken ashore. Before dawn it is hoped to land enough horses
         to secure the mobility of the mountain artillery brigade and one battery
         R.F.A., and it is hoped that within the first 24 hours the
         disembarkation of all the personnel, horses and vehicles enumerated in
         the attached table will be complete.</p>
      
      
      <p>One brigade R.F.A. 11th Division, 1/4th Lowland 5th Howitzer Brigade
         (two batteries) and the 10th Heavy Battery, will be landed at Anzac
         before the operations commence, and their personnel and horses will
         disembark on the morning following your disembarkation, and will then be
         directed along the beach to join your command.</p>
      
      
      <p>Water is plentiful throughout the Anafarta Valley, but pending the
         disembarkation of water carts a number of mules with special 8-gallon
         water bags will be attached to the units of your command.</p>

      <p>P.S.--This letter is never to be out of an officer's possession, and if,

      <p>TABLE.</p>
      
      
      <p>Organization Orders for Troops Landing at Anzac.</p>
      
      
      <p>1. Troops landing at Anzac are to land equipped as follows:</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>F.S. equipment, including respirator;</p>
      
      
      <p>Pack and waterproof sheet;</p>
      
      
      <p>No blanket.</p>
      
      
      <p>Officers' kit reduced to what they can carry.</p>
      
      
      <p>No transport of any kind will be available to move baggage or equipment.</p>
      
      
      <p>Ammunition S.A.A. 200 rounds per rifle or person; 3,500 rounds per
         machine-gun in belt boxes.</p>
      
      
      <p>No regimental reserve S.A.A.</p>
      
      
      <p>Gun, limbers and wagons filled with fused shell.</p>
      
      
      <p>Water bottles--filled.</p>
      
      
      <p>Rations--iron rations one day meat and biscuit, two days' groceries.</p>
      
      
      <p>Sufficient to provide breakfasts.</p>
      
      
      <p>(Fuel will be issued on shore.)</p>
      
      
      <p>Tools--infantry. Regimental reserve distributed to individuals and
         carried on person; Brigade reserve entrenching tools distributed to
         units, by them to individuals and carried on person.</p>
      
      
      <p>Engineers--tools for road making and entrenching work--carried on
         person.</p>
      
      
      <p>Other arms--usual allotment.</p>
      
      
      <p>Signal company cable and equipment usually carried in carts to be
         transferred to barrows.</p>
      
      
      <p>Ambulances--all available stretchers and equipment of dressing stations
         only. Tent sub-divisions in readiness to rejoin early.</p>
      
      
      <p>A.S.C.--Small allowance of distributing equipment, to be brought by
         advance parties of S. and T. personnel.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Establishments.</p>
      
      
      <p>2. No horses, attendants or drivers are to land. Brigade Sections of
         Signal Companies are to land with the brigades they serve.</p>
      
      
      <p>Tent sub-divisions of field ambulances are not to land.</p>
      
      
      <p>Equipment carried in technical vehicles is to be transferred to vehicles
         which can be hand-propelled or else carried on person.</p>
      
      
      <p>3. Troops should disembark into lighters, etc., in complete units,
         companies, platoons, and so on, unless much space is sacrificed in so
         doing.</p>
      
      
      <p>4. All troops should land wearing two white 6-inch armlets and a white
         patch on back of right shoulder.</p>
      
      
      <p>5. No lights or noise are to be permitted while disembarking; troops
         will move into the lighters or horseboats as quickly as possible.</p>
      
      
      <p>6. On disembarking troops will be met by staff officers and guides, and
         will be marched off direct to the ground allotted to them--in no case
         more than 1,200 yards from the beach. All kit brought must be removed by
         the troops, and must be taken out of the lighters at the same time as
         the troops leave.</p>
      
      
      <p>Special parties to assist with the machine-gun and other loads are to be
         detailed in the load of each lighter.</p>
      
      
      <p>7. No lights or talking are permitted on the beach or till the troops
         reach their allotted area. Fires are not to be lit in any area till 4.15
         a.m., and must be extinguished by 8 p.m. Green wood is not to be used;
         the smoke it causes will draw shell fire.</p>
      
      
      <p>8. No troops are to leave the area allotted to them between 4 a.m. and 8
         p.m. except on special duty with the authority of the Brigade Commander.
         Piquets will be placed under area arrangements at intervals round the
         area to prevent men straying independently.</p>
      
      
      <p>9. Troops may be exposed to desultory shelling during the day or night.
         This is never aimed, and the best protection against it is to move into
         the bottom of the gully in which the troops are bivouacked.</p>
      
      
      <p>10. Troops are not to use any portion of the iron ration with which they
         land. Issues will be made under brigade arrangements of rations and
         extras to last the period of their stay.</p>
      
      
      <p>11. Water is issued on ration at one gallon fresh water per day. This
         includes water for all purposes. For bathing, the sea is available, but
         may only be visited after 9 p.m. daily.</p>
      
      
      <p>12. Latrines for immediate use are dug and marked in each area;
         additional latrines are to be prepared by units and the strictest
         orders issued to prevent fouling the ground. Latrines are to be made
         very deep, as space is much restricted.</p>
      
      
      <p>13. Casualties of any kind after treatment in the field ambulance
         affiliated to the brigade will be taken to the casualty clearing station
         in Anzac Cove for removal to Hospital Ship.</p>
      
      
      <p>Urgent cases at any time; others as far as possible between 7.30 and
         8.30 p.m. and between 6 and 9 a.m.</p>
      
      
      <p>14. The following is to be practised by all troops after landing:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>Falling in once during the night in any close formation, and to remain
         so closed up for a period of at least half an hour, during which passing
         of commands (messages from front to rear and back again and to the
         flanks) is to be practised.</p>
      
      
      <p>The troops must be accustomed to the starlight, which may be expected
         during night operations.</p>
      
      
      <p>15. If aeroplanes pass overhead troops are not to look up, as this will
         give away the position of bodies of troops and probably draw shell fire.</p>
      
      
      <p>16. Troops landing should be provided with Maps 1/20,000 of the area in
         which operations are to take place. These maps to be in bulk, and not
         issued till after landing.</p>
      
      
      <p>Maps 1/10,000 of the Anzac area showing roads and bivouacs will be
         issued to unit commanders on arrival.</p>
      
      
      <p>17. Telephone lines will be found laid from Anzac Headquarters to points
         suitable for Brigade or higher Headquarters. On arrival brigades will
         join up these points to Anzac.</p>
      
      
      <p>An officer and two orderlies per brigade will also be detailed to remain
         at Anzac Headquarters.</p>
      
      
      <p>Staffs of formations higher than brigades will be located within easy
         reach of Anzac Headquarters.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>G.S.R. Z. 18/2.</p>
      
      
      <p> Instructions for G.O.C. 9th Army Corps. </p>
      
      
      <p>Reference Sheet Anafarta Sagir <span class="location">Gallipoli</span> Map 1/20,000.</p>
      
      
      <p>1. The intentions of the General Commanding for the impending
         operations, and a rough outline of the task which he has allotted to the
         troops under your command, were communicated to you in my G.S.R. Z. 18,
         dated 22nd instant.</p>
      
      
      <p>2. In addition to the information contained in paragraph 3 of the above
         quoted letter, small numbers of <span class="location">Turkish</span> mounted troops and Gendarmerie
         have been reported in the country north of Anzac, and three guns with
         limbers, each drawn by six oxen, have been seen moving into Anafarta
         Sagir. An aeroplane photograph has also disclosed the presence of a few
         trenches on Lala Baba. A sketch of these trenches, which have apparently
         been constructed for some months, is attached. It is believed that the
         channel connecting the Salt Lake with <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay is now dry.</p>
      
      
      <p>3. Your landing will begin on the night 6th/7th August. Your primary
         objective will be to secure <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay as a base for all the forces
         operating in the northern zone. Owing to the difficult nature of the
         terrain, it is possible that the attainment of this objective will, in
         the first instance, require the use of the whole of the troops at your
         disposal. Should, however, you find it possible to achieve this object
         with only a portion of your force, your next step will be to give such
         direct assistance as is in your power to the G.O.C. Anzac in his attack
         on Hill 305, by an advance on Biyuk Anafarta, with the object of moving
         up the eastern spurs of that hill.</p>
      
      
      <p>4. Subject only to his final approval, the General Commanding gives you
         an entirely free hand in the selection of your plan of operations.</p>
      
      
      <p>He, however, directs your special attention to the fact that the hills
         Yilghin and Ismail Oglu Tepe are known to contain guns which can bring
         fire to bear on the flank and rear of an attack on Hill 305, and that on
         this account they assume an even greater importance in the first
         instance than if they were considered merely part of a position covering
         <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay. If, therefore, it is possible, without prejudice to the
         attainment of your primary objective, to gain possession of these hills
         at an early period of your attack, it will greatly facilitate the
         capture and retention of Hill 305. It would also appear almost certain
         that until these hills are in your possession it will be impossible to
         land either troops or stores in the neighbourhood of <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay by day.</p>
      
      
      <p>5. The troops at your disposal will be:--</p>
      
      
      <p>11th Division (less one Brigade R.F.A., at <span class="location">Helles</span>).</p>
      
      
      <p>10th Division (less 29th Infantry Brigade).</p>
      
      
      <p>Three squadrons R.N. Armoured Car Division, R.N.A.S. (one squadron motor
         cycles, six machine guns; one squadron Ford cars, six machine guns; one
         squadron armoured cars, six machine guns).</p>
      
      
      <p>Two Highland Mountain Artillery batteries.</p>
      
      
      <p>An endeavour will be made to release for your force one or more 5-in.
         howitzer batteries, now at Anzac, during the day following your initial
         disembarkation.</p>
      
      
      <p>6. In order that you may be able to arrange for the disembarkation of
         your force to agree, so far as Naval exigencies will admit, with the
         plan of operations on which you decide, the allocation of troops to the
         ships and boats to be provided by the Navy is left to your decision.</p>
      
      
      <p>With this object, tables have been drawn up, and are enclosed with these
         instructions, showing the craft which can be placed at your disposal by
         the Navy, their capacity, and the points at which the troops can be
         disembarked. The tables also show what numbers of troops, animals,
         vehicles, and stores can be landed simultaneously.</p>
      
      
      <p>The beaches available for your landing on the first night are (1) a
         frontage of 600 yards in <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay (sq. 117 Q.V.); (2) a frontage of
         1,800 yards S. of Kuchuk Kemikli (sq. 9, 103 z, 104 V; 91 A.B.), called
         "New Beach" in the tables. It will not be possible in the first instance
         to land more than one brigade of your force in <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay, though other
         vessels can simultaneously be discharging their passengers on New Beach.</p>
      
      
      <p>7. As regards the time at which the disembarkation may be expected to
         commence, no craft will be allowed to leave Kephalos Harbour till after
         dark, and the passage across will take from one and a half to two hours.
         It is unsafe, therefore, to count on any troops being ashore before
         10.30 p.m., and in no case must your approach be disclosed to the enemy
         till 10 p.m., the hour at which the outposts on the left flank of the
         Anzac position are to be rushed.</p>
      
      
      <p>8. No allowance has been made in the tables for the disembarkation of
         your headquarters, as it is not known at what period of the operations
         you will wish them to land.</p>
      
      
      <p>9. Special attention is directed to paragraph 8 of my letter G.S.R. Z.
         18, dated 22nd July.</p>
      
      
      <p>10. The infantry of the <span class="unit">53rd Division</span> will be available as Army Reserve,
         and will be at the disposal of the General Commanding.</p>
      
      
      <p>11. Special instructions regarding signal communications will be issued
         later. In general terms the arrangements will be as follows:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>There is a submarine cable between <span class="location">Imbros</span> and Anzac, and a cable will be
         laid as soon as practicable from <span class="location">Imbros</span> to <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay. A submarine cable
         and a land cable will also be laid between Anzac and <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay as soon
         as circumstances permit, probably before dawn. Pending the completion of
         this work inter-communication between Anzac and <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay will be
         carried out by lamp, and, subject to Naval approval, between <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay
         and <span class="location">Imbros</span> by wireless telegraphy.</p>
      
      
      <p>Two[18] military pack W.T. stations and one R.N. Base W.T. station will
         be provided at <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay, four naval ratings will be attached to each
         station as visual signalling personnel. One of these military pack W.T.
         stations will be disembarked with the second brigade to land, and will
         act as a base station pending the arrival of the R.N. Base wireless
         station. The second military pack W.T. station will be disembarked with
         the third brigade to land; it will be placed on a flank and used mainly
         for fire control under the B.G.R.A.</p>
      
      
      <p>A wagon wireless station at G.H.Q., <span class="location">Imbros</span>, will be in communication
         with both these pack W.T. stations.</p>
      
      
      <p>One officer and 23 other ranks, with two pack animals from the Brigade
         Signal Section, will be landed with each Infantry Brigade.</p>
      
      
      <p>These parties will lay their cable by hand and establish telephone and
         vibrator communication from the beach forward. No vehicles will be
         landed in the first instance, all necessary stores being man-handled.</p>
      
      
      <p>Three officers, 74 other ranks, 28 animals and five vehicles will be
         landed with Divisional Headquarters.</p>
      
      
      <p>The advance parties will release the brigade sections from the beach and
         be prepared to lay cable lines by hand.</p>
      
      
      <p>Two cable wagons will be included in the five vehicles, and should be
         the first of those vehicles to be disembarked.</p>
      
      
      <p>The above would admit of the disembarkation before dawn at and in the
         neighbourhood of <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay of:--</p>
      
      
      <p>Divisional Headquarters.
         Signal Co. with 40 horses.
         1 W.T. Section and 2 W.T. Stations.
         H.Q. F.A. Bde. (18-pr.) with 10 horses.
         1 F.A. Battery (18-pr.) with 82 horses.
         2 Mountain Batteries with 80 horses.
         3 Field Companies R.E.
         3 Infantry Brigades and part of remainder of F.A. Bde. (personnel).
         1 Pioneer Battalion.
         2 Battalions for Beach parties and part of Ammn. Park personnel.
         2 Platoons Divl. Cyclist Co. and part of Tent Sub-divisions of Field
         Ambulances.
         Bearer Subdivisions of 3 Field Ambulances and part of Casualty Clearing
         Stations.</p>
      
      
      <p>The 10 motor lighters will land their complements first, and then the troops
         from the 10 Destroyers, the two sloops and their tows, and the trawler and her
         tows, can proceed simultaneously on a front of about 600 yards in <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay and
         1,800 on the beach south of <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay, directly beach secured. The two landing
         places are about 2 miles apart. The landing of the troops from H.M.S.
         Endymion  and  Theseus  may be able to take place simultaneously, or
         may have to be deferred until the motor lighters have cleared the destroyers.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>The above will provide for the disembarkation of the remainder of the
         troops, etc., enumerated in Tables C and E, appended to letter G.S.R. Z.
         18 of 23rd July, that is those not already detailed to be landed before
         dawn, viz.:--</p>
      
      
      <p>Remainder of F.A. Brigade (18 pr.).
         Remainder of Ammunition Park Personnel.
         15th Heavy Battery R.G.A.
         Brigade Ammunition Column.
         Remainder of Casualty Clearing Stations.
         Mule Corps.
         Also 4,000,000 rds. S.A.A. Reserve Gun Ammunition
         (by special trawlers from <span class="location">Mudros</span>) 7 days' supplies
         for the above troops and animals.</p>
      
      
      <p>As soon as possible after Corps Headquarters go ashore, the personnel of
         the Divisional Signal Companies will be released from work at the beach.</p>
      
      
      <p>Arrangements will be made subsequently to disembark an air line
         detachment and a cable section to provide and pole local lines.</p>
      
      
      <p>The remainder of the Corps Headquarters Signal Company will be kept in
         readiness to be forwarded as soon as Corps Headquarters reports that
         circumstances admit of its disembarkation.</p>

         29th July, 1915. </p>
      
      
      
      <p>  G.S.R. Z. 18/2.                                     July 29th. </p>
      
      
      <p>  GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING,
         8TH CORPS.</p>
      
      
      <p>The General Commanding has decided that his next main attack shall be
         made in the vicinity of Anzac with the object of placing ourselves
         astride the Peninsula to the north of Kilid Bahr.</p>
      
      
      <p>2. The 8th Corps with attached troops is to assist this main operation
         by offensive action in the south, the scope and form of this action
         being determined solely with reference to its effects on the main
         operation.</p>
      
      
      <p>As the decisive point will be in the neighbourhood of Anzac, all
         reinforcements will be utilized in that theatre, and it is improbable
         that any will be available for the southern zone before the middle of
         August, except such drafts for the 8th Corps and the Corps Exp. Orient
         as may reach the Peninsula in the next ten days.</p>
      
      
      <p>3. In order to free sufficient troops to enable the 8th Corps to take
         the offensive, the French will take over part of the line as defined in
         Force Order No. 22.</p>
      
      
      <p>4. In addition to the troops of the 8th Corps and R.N.D. at present at
         your disposal, the following reinforcements may be expected:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  29th Division       280 due 29th July.
         29th Division       900 due 4th August.
         <span class="unit">42nd Division</span>       100 due 29th July.
         -----
         Total             1,280</p>
      
      
      <p>which, allowing for normal wastage, should give an effective total of
         24,780 on 5th August. These numbers, with the shorter line you will be
         called upon to hold, should leave you with sufficient troops to
         undertake a limited offensive operation on or about that day.</p>
      
      
      <p>5. Assuming that you are not attacked in the meanwhile, the total amount
         of ammunition which should be available at <span class="location">Helles</span> early in August for
         offensive action, and to maintain a reserve is:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  18 pr.       36,000   }
         4.5 inch      2,000   }    Plus any amounts saved
         5 inch        4,000   }    from normal daily expenditure.
         6 inch          545   }
         60 pr.        3,000   }</p>
      
      
      <p>but it must be borne in mind that no replacements can be looked for
         before August 16th.</p>
      
      
      <p>6. The scope of your offensive action must be based upon these figures,
         and it is thought that the most suitable objective will be the capture
         of the <span class="location">Turkish</span> trenches up to the line F. 13, G. 13, H. 13, and H. 12.
         Plans for this operation should, therefore, be undertaken at once.</p>
      
      
      <p>7. Pre-supposing that this attack is successful, and that the numbers at
         your disposal admit of a further advance, the capture of the trenches on
         the line H. 14 to H. 15, followed perhaps by the capture of Krithia
         could then be undertaken, and plans for this action should be prepared
         beforehand. But as the launching of this further attack must be entirely
         dependent on unknown factors, a definite decision on this point cannot
         be arrived at beforehand. It is, moreover, essential that the plan of
         your first attack should not definitely commit your troops to a further
         advance unless the trend of events should render such a course
         desirable.</p>
      
      
      <p>8. As regards the date for launching your first attack, it is thought
         that the most favourable time would be shortly before the main
         operations at Anzac begin, and you should therefore arrange for your
         first attack to take place on the 4th August.</p>
      
      
      <p>9. Beyond holding the enemy in front of them to their positions and
         assisting you with artillery fire, the French will not be asked to take
         part in your first attack, but, in the event of your reaching Krithia,
         they will be directed to conform to your movements and to establish
         themselves on the spurs leading up to <span class="location">Achi Baba</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>I will ascertain the amount of artillery support and lean you can expect
         from the C.E.O., and if the information arrives in time will attach it
         as an appendix to this letter.</p>
      
      
      <p>10. The possibility of the southern force being able to capture Achi
         Baba has not been dealt with in this memorandum, as the attempt should
         only be made in the event of large reinforcements being available for
         the southern zone, and these must depend on the course of events in the
         main theatre.</p>

         Mediterranean Expeditionary Force. </p>
      
      
      <p>It will be apparent to you how necessary it is not to allow any
         suspicion of the reason for the date mentioned in paragraph 8 being told
         to any person other than your Brigadier-General G.S.</p>

      <p> French Artillery Support for 8th Corps. </p>
      
      
      <p>1. One Brigade of 75's will be placed at the disposal of the 8th Corps
         for the attack on 4th-5th August.</p>
      
      
      <p>Of these</p>
      
      
      <p>( a ) One battery will be moved to support closely the attack on
         Krithia.</p>
      
      
      <p>( b ) One battery will fire up the Nullah E. of Krithia.</p>
      
      
      <p>2. In addition, six French howitzers will be so disposed as to open fire
         upon <span class="location">Turkish</span> artillery north of the ridge 150--<span class="location">Achi Baba</span> peak.</p>

      <p>Reference Map Anafarta Sagir <span class="location">Gallipoli</span> Map 1/20,000.</p>
      
      
      <p>1. The General Commanding has decided to mass the whole of his
         reinforcements in and immediately north of the area occupied by the
         corps under your command, with a view to securing <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay as a base of
         operations, driving the enemy off the <span class="location">Sari Bair</span>, and eventually securing
         a position astride the <span class="location">Gallipoli</span> Peninsula from the neighbourhood of
         Gaba Tepe to the straits north of Maidos.</p>
      
      
      <p>2. The general outline for your proposals for the action of the A. and
         N.Z. Army Corps contained in your G a 89 of 1st July are approved.</p>
      
      
      <p>3. ( a ) The General Commanding wishes your operations to begin on
         August 6th with a strong and sustained attack on Hill 125 (Plateau 400),
         every effort being made to deceive the enemy as to the locality against
         which our main effort is to be made, and to induce him to believe that
         it will be directed against his lines opposite the southern portion of
         your position. In pursuance of this object the Vice-Admiral has arranged
         that H.M. ships shall in the meantime display increased activity off
         the coast between Gaba Tepe and Kum Tepe. It has been arranged that
         soundings shall be taken by night off the coast south of Gaba Tepe; and,
         on the evening of August 6th, a naval demonstration will be made off
         this part of the coast, H.M. ships being accompanied by a number of
         trawlers as if a landing were to be undertaken.</p>
      
      
      <p>( b ) The General Commanding further concurs in the subsequent sequence
         of the operations outlined by you, namely:--</p>
      
      
      <p>(i) The clearing of the enemy's outposts from the ridges facing Nos. 2
         and 3 posts, to be undertaken after nightfall.</p>
      
      
      <p>(ii) An attack in as great strength as possible up the Sazli Beit Dere,
         the Chailak Dere and the Aghyl Dere, against the Chunuk Bair ridge, by
         night.</p>
      
      
      <p>(iii) When the Chunuk Bair ridge is gained, a converging attack from
         that ridge, and from the north-eastern section of your present position,
         against Hill 180 (Baby 700).</p>
      
      
      <p>4. ( a ) For the above operations the following troops will be at your
         disposal:--</p>
      
      
      <p>A. and N.Z. Army Corps. <span class="unit">13th Division</span>, less all artillery except 69th
         F.A. (Howitzer) Brigade. 29th Brigade (10th Division). 29th <span class="location">Indian</span>
         Brigade.</p>
      
      
      <p>( b ) At the date of commencement of the operations the following troops
         belonging to or attached to the 9th Army Corps will be at Anzac, but
         will not, except so far as is stated hereunder, be at your disposal:--</p>
      
      
      <p>One F.A. Brigade, 11th Division: To rejoin 9th Army Corps as soon as
         horses are landed.</p>
      
      
      <p>10th Heavy Battery, R.G.A.: Ditto.</p>
      
      
      <p>14th Lowland (Howitzer) Brigade (two Batteries): Arrangements must be
         made so that these batteries may be free to rejoin the 9th Army Corps
         before nightfall on August 7th.</p>
      
      
      <p>5. The operations carried out by the Corps under your command will form
         part of a general combined offensive undertaken by the whole of the
         forces of the <span class="location">Gallipoli</span> Peninsula and by the 9th Army Corps, which will
         be disembarked in the neighbourhood of <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay, beginning on the night
         of August 6th-7th.</p>
      
      
      <p>( a ) The 8th Army Corps, in conjunction with the Corps Expéditionnaire,
         will attack the <span class="location">Turkish</span> lines south of Krithia on August 4th and 5th.
         The attack will be made on a large scale, and will be vigorously
         pressed, and it is hoped that by its means the enemy will be induced to
         move part of his central reserves southward into the Cape <span class="location">Helles</span> zone
         during the 5th and 6th, so that they may not be available in the
         northern zone on the 6th and 7th.</p>
      
      
      <p>( b ) The 9th Army Corps will begin landing in and close to <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay
         during the night of August 6th-7th. Three infantry brigades, with one
         field and two mountain batteries, engineers and medical services, should
         be ashore before dawn, and will be closely followed by two more infantry
         brigades and additional artillery and engineers.</p>
      
      
      <p>The G.O.C. 9th Army Corps has been informed:--</p>
      
      
      <p>(i) That his mission is to secure <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay as a base of operation for
         all the forces in the northern zone.</p>
      
      
      <p>(ii) That the seizure of Yilghin Burnu and Ismail Oglu Tepe ("W" and
         Chocolate Hills), on account of the presence there of artillery which
         may interfere with your operations, must be considered as of very
         special importance.</p>
      
      
      <p>(iii) That so far as is possible after the fulfilment of his primary
         mission, he is to render you such direct assistance as may be
         practicable by moving any available troops via Biyuk Anafarta up the
         eastern slopes of the <span class="location">Sari Bair</span>.</p>
      
      
      <p>( c ) At the commencement of these operations the infantry of the 53rd
         Division will be available as Army Reserve and will be at the disposal
         of the General Commanding.</p>
      
      
      <p>6. The Vice-Admiral has agreed provisionally to the following allotment
         of ships affording naval support to the operations:--</p>
      
      
      <p>In <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay: One 6-in. monitor.</p>
      
      
      <p>South of Kuchuk: H.M.S.  Endymion .</p>
      
      
      <p>Kemliki (Nibrunesi Point): H.M.S.  Edgar , H.M.S.  Talbot , one 6-in.
         monitor, one 9.2-in. monitor. These ships would be in position at
         daylight on August 7th, and would mainly be required to support the
         operations of the 9th Army Corps.</p>
      
      
      <p>     West of Gaba Tepe: H.M.S.  Baccanto , H.M.S.  Humber , H.M.S.
         Havelock , one 6-in. monitor.</p>
      
      
      <p>These ships would be in position at 3 p.m. on August 6th, except H.M.S.
         Havelock , which would be in position at daylight on August 7th. They
         would be detailed for support of the right flank of the A. and N.Z. Army
         Corps.</p>
      
      
      <p>     Off Kum Tepe: One 6-in. monitor.</p>
      
      
      <p>A separate communication is being sent to you with regard to the final
         settlement of details as to the support of the operations by naval guns,
         allocation of targets, etc.</p>
      
      
      <p>7. Special instructions regarding signal communication will be issued
         later. In general terms the arrangements will be as follows:--</p>
      
      
      <p>A submarine cable and a land cable will be laid between Anzac and <span class="location">Suvla</span>
         Bay as soon as circumstances permit.</p>
      
      
      <p>A submarine cable will also be laid as soon as practicable between
         <span class="location">Imbros</span> and <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay. Pending the completion of connection between
         Anzac and <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay, inter-communication will be carried out by
         lamp.</p>
      
      
      <p>Two military pack W/T stations and a R.N. Base W/T station will be
         established in the vicinity of <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay. The W/T station at Anzac
         will be able to intercept messages from seaplanes, but must not
         attempt to reply.</p>
      
      
      <p>W/T via the ships will be an alternative means of communication between
         G.H.Q. and the troops ashore in case of interruption of cable
         communication.</p>
      
      
      <p>A system of flares will be arranged for employment on the left flank of
         your position at dawn on August 7th to indicate to the ships the
         positions reached by the troops.</p>
      
      
      <p>8. G.H.Q. will in the first instance be at <span class="location">Imbros</span>.</p>

      <p>1. The total forces of the enemy in the <span class="location">Gallipoli</span> Peninsula are
         estimated at 100,000.</p>
      
      
      <p>Of these, 27,000 are in the neighbourhood of Anzac (5th, 19th, 16th
         Divisions, and 18th and 64th Regiments); 36,000 are in the Southern zone
         (1st, 4th, 6th Division less one regiment, 7th Division, 11th Division
         less one regiment, and one regiment each of the 12th, 25th and 3rd
         Divisions); and 37,000 are in Reserve (9th Division less one regiment,
         12th less one regiment, 13th, 14th, and 25th less one regiment, and 10th
         Divisions). Of this reserve force two Divisions are in the Bulair
         district and one Division in the Eyerli Tepe zone. There are 12,000 on
         the Asiatic shore of the <span class="location">Dardanelles</span> (<span class="unit">2nd Division</span> and <span class="unit">8th Division</span> less
         one regiment). There are believed to be five Divisions (45,000 men) in
         the Keshan area belonging to the 5th and 6th Corps.</p>
      
      
      <p>All reports tend to show that though the enemy may be expected to fight
         well in trenches, their  moral  has suffered considerably as a result of
         their recent heavy casualties, and that their stock of ammunition is
         low.</p>
      
      
      <p>2. The General Commanding intends to carry out a combined and
         simultaneous attack on the enemy in the northern and southern zone
         commencing on 6th August, in accordance with the special instructions
         already issued to the Corps Commanders concerned.</p>
      
      
      <p>During the first phase of these operations the <span class="unit">13th Division</span> (less three
         18-pdr. Bdes. R.F.A.), the 29th Infantry Brigade will be attached to the
         A. and N.Z. Army Corps. Three squadrons R.N. Armoured Car Division and
         two batteries Highland Mounted Artillery will be attached to 9th Corps.
         86th Brigade R.F.A. and 91st Heavy Battery R.G.A. will be attached to
         8th Corps.</p>
      
      
      <p>3. Special instructions regarding embarkation and disembarkation are
         issued to G.O.C. 9th Corps, G.O.C., A. and N.Z. Corps, and I.G.C., as
         appended to this order.</p>
      
      
      <p>4. The <span class="unit">53rd Division</span> will remain at the disposal of the General
         Commanding as general reserve.</p>
      
      
      <p>5. G.H.Q. will remain in the first instance in its present situation.</p>

      <p> Embarkations. </p>
      
      
      <p>1. The embarkation of units of the 9th Corps concentrated at <span class="location">Imbros</span> will
         be carried out under the orders of G.O.C. 9th Corps, commencing for
         personnel on 6th August, for vehicles and stores at such earlier date as
         may be convenient. The necessary ships and boats (lists of which have
         already been handed to the G.O.C. Corps) will be assembled in the
         harbour beforehand; and the embarkation programme will be worked out in
         consultation with Commander Ashby, R.N., who has been detailed by the
         Vice-Admiral for this purpose, and who will arrange for the various
         vessels to be in their allotted positions at the hours arranged.</p>
      
      
      <p>G.O.C. 9th Corps will also be responsible for the allocation to ships or
         lighters, and for the embarkation of the following units:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>At <span class="location">Imbros</span>: One W.T. Section (Nos. W. 10 and W. 11 Pack Wireless
         Stations); Two Anson Battalions R.N.D. (for duties on the beach); No. 16
         Casualty Clearing Station.</p>
      
      
      <p>In transit from <span class="location">Mudros</span> to <span class="location">Imbros</span>: One Casualty Clearing Station.</p>
      
      
      <p>Units and formations concentrated at <span class="location">Mudros</span> and Mitylene will be
         embarked for their various destinations under the orders of I.G.C. in
         accordance with the programme already issued to that officer.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> Military Transport Officers. </p>
      
      
      <p>2. G.O.C. 9th Corps and I.G.C. respectively will ensure that an officer
         is appointed Military Transport Officer on every ship for the
         embarkation of which they are severally responsible ( vide  paragraph
         1).</p>
      
      
      
      <p> Landing Places. </p>
      
      
      <p>3. The landings of the 9th Corps will be referred to as "A," "B," and
         "C" Beaches.</p>
      
      
      <p>"A" Beach--Square 117.q. and v.</p>
      
      
      <p>"C" Beach--Square 103.u.z.</p>
      
      
      <p>"B" Beach--Square 91.b, i, o.</p>
      
      
      <p>"C" and "B" Beaches are practically contiguous.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> Beach Control Personnel. </p>
      
      
      <p>4. The following naval and military beach control personnel have been
         appointed for the landing places of the 9th Corps:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>Principal Beach Master: Captain H. F. G. Talbot, R.N.</p>
      
      
      <p>Beach Masters: Commander I. W. Gibson, M.V.O. ("A" Beach), Captain C. P.
         Metcalfe, R.N. ("B" Beach), Commander C. Tindal-Carril-Worsley ("C"

      <p>Assistant Beach Masters and Beach Lieutenants: Four Lieutenant
         Commanders, ten Lieutenants, R.N.</p>
      
      
      <p>Principal Mil. L.O.: Colonel W. G. B. Western, C.B.</p>
      
      
      <p>Mil. L.O.'s: Major F. W. Pencock, Derbyshire Yeomanry, Major Sir R.
         Baker, Dorset Yeomanry, Captain Tylsen Wright, A.S.C.</p>
      
      
      <p>Assistant Mil. L.O.'s: Captain Wade Palmer, Derbyshire Yeomanry, Captain
         B. A. Smith, South Notts Hussars, Lieutenant H. V. Browne, Dorset
         Yeomanry, Lieutenant Krabbe, Berks Yeomanry.</p>
      
      
      <p>The allocation of the above military officers to the various landing
         places will be detailed by the P.M.L.O. in consultation with the P.B.M.</p>
      
      
      <p>Special instructions with regard to beach fatigue parties have already
         been issued to the G.O.C. 9th Corps.</p>
      
      
      <p>G.O.C., A. and N.Z. Army Corps will detail such military landing
         officers, assistant military landing officers, and beach parties for
         A.N.Z.A.C. as he may consider necessary. The names of officers so
         appointed will be reported as early as possible to V.A. and to G.H.Q.</p>
      
      
      <p>The following special service officers are attached to H.Q., A. and N.Z.
         Army Corps, for such duties in connection with the landing as the G.O.C.
         may direct:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>Major P. R. Bruce, S. Notts Hussars.</p>
      
      
      <p>Captain C. R. Higgens, County of London Yeomanry.</p>
      
      
      <p>Captain Sir E. Pauncefort Duncombe, Royal Bucks Hussars.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> General Instructions for Landing. </p>
      
      
      <p>5. All troops will land with two iron rations (one day's meat only in
         case of troops disembarking at Anzac). Infantry will carry 200 rounds of
         S.A.A., machine-gun sections 3,500 rounds. Packs will not be worn. A
         proportion of heavy entrenching tools, signalling and medical gear will
         be carried by hand. Camp kettles will be handed to the Ordnance Officer
         of the camp at which units concentrate before embarkation. They will be
         forwarded and reissued at the first opportunity.</p>
      
      
      <p>6. Horses will be landed harnessed, and with nosebags filled to their
         full capacity.</p>
      
      
      <p>Poles of G.S. wagons will be removed before slinging and made fast to
         the body of the wagon. Poles of carts, limbers, and limbered wagons will
         not be removed; these vehicles should be so placed in the boats that
         they can be landed pole leading.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> Ammunition. </p>
      
      
      <p>7. The G.O.C. 9th Corps will depute an officer to arrange, in
         consultation with the P.M.L.O., for the storing of reserve ammunition in
         convenient localities near the beach. Guards for these stores may be
         found from the beach fatigue parties.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> Water. </p>
      
      
      <p>8. The strictest economy must be exercised with regard to drinking
         water. Under arrangements already made by G.H.Q., receptacles filled
         with water will be landed as early as possible from the ships carrying
         the mule corps, and will be conveyed to the troops as transport becomes
         available. Waterproof tanks (2,300 gallon capacity) and lift and force
         pumps will be available on the  Prah --R.E. Storeship--in Kephalos
         Harbour, and will be forwarded by D.Q.M.G., G.H.Q., on request of G.O.C.
         Corps.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> Transport. </p>
      
      
      <p>9. Transport to supplement that in possession of units will be provided
         for the 9th Corps and the A.N.Z. Corps by the <span class="location">Indian</span> Mule Corps. The
         amount of transport for each formation has been calculated to carry
         rations, water, and S.A.A., making one or two trips a day, according to
         the anticipated distance of the various units from the beach.</p>
      
      
      <p>This transport will be handed over, as it is landed, by an officer
         appointed by the D.S.T., to transport officers of Brigades and
         divisional troops for allotment as circumstances may require.</p>
      
      
      <p>Senior transport officers of Divisions will be ordered to report to the
         following representatives of the D.S.T. immediately on landing:--</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>At Anzac: Lieutenant-Colonel Streidinger, A.D.T.</p>
      
      
      <p>At "A" Beach: Major Badcock, D.A.D.T.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> Supplies. </p>
      
      
      <p>10. A supply depôt has been formed at Anzac, and it is in charge of
         Major Izod, A.S.C. A supply depot will be formed by D.S.T. at "A" Beach
         as soon as supplies can be landed, and will be in charge of Major
         Huskisson, A.S.C. Senior supply officers of Divisions will be ordered to
         place themselves in communication with the officer in charge of the
         nearest supply depôt and to keep him informed of their daily
         requirements. Supplies will, so far as possible, be handed over to them
         in bulk at the depôt. Owing to the difficulty in landing sufficient
         animals in the first instance it is possible that only half rations may
         be available on the third and fourth days after the operations begin.
         All units should be specially ordered to husband their rations.</p>
      
      
      
      <p> Medical. </p>
      
      
      <p>11. Arrangements have been made to establish on the beach at Anzac two
         casualty clearing stations, which will be embarked by I.G.C., and two
         at "A" Beach, which will be embarked under orders of G.O.C. 9th Corps
         ( see  paragraph 1). Medical officers will be appointed by G.H.Q. to
         control these units, and to take charge of the arrangements for
         evacuation of the wounded from the beach.</p>

      <p>APPENDIX IV</p>
      
      
      <p>INSTRUCTIONS TO MAJOR-GENERAL H. <span class="person">DE LISLEde</span>, C.B., D.S.O.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>1. The operations of the northern wing of the Army have only been
         partially successful.</p>
      
      
      <p>( a ) The <span class="location">Australia</span> and <span class="location">New Zealand</span> Army Corps, with the <span class="unit">13th Division</span>
         and the 29th Brigade of <span class="unit">10th Division</span> attached, has greatly extended the
         area occupied, and now holds a position under the Chunuk Bair Ridge,
         which the G.O.C. considers a favourable one from which to launch the
         final attack on the ridge. The necessity for reorganization after the
         recent operations, and for establishing a satisfactory system of
         forwarding water, ammunition and supplies, will involve a delay of some
         days before the attack on the main ridge can be made.</p>
      
      
      <p>( b ) The 9th Army Corps, less the 13th Division and 29th Brigade, but
         with the 53rd and 54th Divisions attached, holds the Yilghin Burnu
         hills, and a line northwards from the easternmost of these two hills
         roughly straight across the Kuchuk Anafarta Ova to the highest point of
         the Kiretch Tepe Sirt. Attacks by the 11th Division against the Ismail
         Oglu Tepe and the Anafarta spur from the north-west have been made
         without any success. In the course of the operations the 9th Corps
         became very much disorganized, and since August 11th the work of
         reorganization and consolidation has been proceeding.</p>
      
      
      <p>2. At present the enemy has shown no great strength north of an east and
         west line through Anafarta Sagir. He has a force operating on and near
         the Kiretch Tepe Sirt, the strength of which cannot yet be accurately
         estimated. From present indications this appears to be a detachment
         which is known to have guarded the coast from Ejelmer Bay to <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay;
         it does not appear to have been reinforced to any extent. Across the
         Kuchuk Anafarta Ova there appear to be no more than snipers. In the
         region Anafarta Sagir--Ismail Oglu Tepe and the Biyuk Anafarta Valley
         the enemy has developed considerable strength--his intention being, no
         doubt, to protect the right of his main force which opposes the
         <span class="location">Australia</span> and <span class="location">New Zealand</span> Army Corps, and to prevent our advance on the
         Anafarta gap.</p>
      
      
      <p>3. The General Commanding has decided to strike as quickly and in as
         great strength as possible against the enemy's on the line Ismail Oglu
         Tepe--Anafarta Sagir with the objects, first, of driving in this flank
         and preparing a further enveloping advance; and, secondly, by clearing
         the Anafarta spur to deny to the enemy the gun positions and facilities
         for observation therefrom, which would otherwise endanger <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay. He
         considers it imperative to effect this with the least possible delay. In
         his view the left flank of this advance will require comparatively
         little protection, at all events in the first instance, in view of the
         difficulty which the enemy may be expected to find in throwing any
         considerable force round our left over the high and difficult country
         north of Anafarta Sagir. It appears that the double purpose of defeating
         the enemy and securing <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay as a port for the northern wing of the
         Army can best be served by an attack on the enemy's right on the
         Anafarta spur, made with all the strength at our command, while leaving
         a comparatively small force as left flank guard to clear the enemy's
         snipers out of the Kuchuk Anafarta Ova and to occupy and press back his
         detachment in the Ejelmer Bay region.</p>
      
      
      <p>4. You will have at your disposal the following troops:--</p>
      
      
      <p>  11th Division,
         10th Division (less 29th Brigade),
         <span class="unit">53rd Division</span>,
         <span class="unit">54th Division</span>,</p>
      
      
      <p>and there is on its way from <span class="location">Egypt</span> to join you the 2nd Mounted Division
         (5,000 men dismounted), which should be available by August 18th. The
         10th, 11th and 53rd Divisions are considerably depleted, and the  moral 
         of the latter at present leaves much to be desired. There are at present
         ashore, belonging to the above two F.A. Brigades (three batteries of
         which are awaiting horses to bring them up from Anzac) and two Heavy
         Batteries. In addition, two Highland Mountain Batteries, attached to the
         9th Corps, are ashore, and the 1/4th Lowland Brigade (two batteries
         5-inch howitzers) are at your disposal when they can be brought up from
         Anzac. It has only been possible to land a bare minimum of horses owing
         to difficulties in respect of water and the landing of forage.</p>
      
      
      <p>Three further F.A. Brigades and the <span class="unit">57th Brigade</span> (two batteries)
         4.5-inch howitzers are at <span class="location">Mudros</span> ready to be brought up as soon as it is
         possible to land them. These Brigades will probably have to be landed
         without any horses in the first instance, and taken into position by the
         artillery horses already ashore.</p>
      
      
      <p>5. For the purpose of an early attack in accordance with the plan
         indicated in paragraph 3, the A. and N.Z. Army Corps will probably not
         be able to co-operate directly with more than one Infantry Brigade, and
         it is possible that it may be able to do no more than swing up its left
         into line with the right of your advance. It is improbable that the 8th
         Corps and the C.E.O. will be in a position to do more than undertake
         vigorous demonstrations.</p>
      
      
      <p>6. With the above in view, you will proceed at once to <span class="location">Suvla</span> Bay and
         take over command of the 9th Corps. Your immediate and most urgent
         concern will be to complete the reorganization of the Corps and to
         prepare as large a force as possible for the offensive against Ismail
         Oglu Tepe and the Anafarta spur, bearing in mind that time is of vital
         importance. You will then consider and report at the earliest moment:--</p>
      
      
      <p>     ( a ) What force you consider that you will be able to employ for
         this purpose.</p>
      
      
      <p>     ( b ) The date on which you will be ready to undertake the
         offensive.</p>
      
      
      <p>     ( c ) The method by which you purpose to carry out your task.</p>
