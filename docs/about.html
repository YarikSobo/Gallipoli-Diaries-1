    <h3>Project Question</h3>
    <p>Sir Ian Hamilton left us behind his diary of the time he spent participating in the Gallipoli Campaign. We are analyzing his diary to determine the major players in this theater of the war at the time through the 
    eyes of this man. What ships did he reference, who did he think about, what places did poeple like Sir Ian Hamilton see? These are the questions we are trying to answer through parsing the writing 
    Sir Ian Hamilton left behind for us.</p>
