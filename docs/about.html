    <h3>Project Question</h3>
    <p>Sir Ian Hamilton left us behind his diary of the time he spent participating in the Gallipoli Campaign. We are analyzing his diary to determine the major players in this theater of the war at the time through the 
    eyes of this man. Sir Ian Hamilton was a highly well-off and seasoned British officer sent with the blessing of Herbert Kitchener to supervise the ongoing campaign at Gallipoli. Throughout his time on the peninsula, he wrote extensively about everything from the mundane to the shocking. 
    We wish to parse his work to find out what ships did he reference, who did he think about, and what places did people like Sir Ian Hamilton see? These are the questions we are trying to answer through parsing the writing 
    Sir Ian Hamilton left behind for us.</p>
