        <h2>Essential Information</h2>
        <p>Initally concived by Winston Churchill and other high-ranking British officials as a promising way to break the stalemate of the First World War, the Gallipoli Campaign saw the British Empire mount an 
        amibitous amphibious assault on the heart of the Ottoman Empire in April of 1915. What awaited the men on board these transports was not an easy knockout blow, however, rather it was fighting vicious
        as it was incessant. The following months would test the bravery, wit, endurance, and so much more of these men before their eventual withdrawal in January 1916. These are firsthand the stories of that campiagn, left to us
        by officer Sir Ian Hamilton following his arrival until his eventual withdrawal from the Peninsula. Through his vivid accounts, you can see a glimpse of the world these men descended into, and see how they reacted to
        the joy, sorrow, valor, confusion, tension, anger, and so much more in the most trying of times.</p>
