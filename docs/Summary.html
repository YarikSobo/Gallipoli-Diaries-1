        <h1>What You Need to Know About Gallipoli</h1>
        <p>The Gallipoli Campaign was the brainchild of the British High Command, led by up-and-coming politician Winston Churchill. Faced with the prospect of a bloody stalemate on the Western Front as the First World War dragged on,
        the prospect of knocking out one of the major powers in the war, the Ottoman Empire, became too tantalizing an opportunity to pass up. Not only would such a move knock out one of the major combatants in the war, a major boon for the allies,
        but it would open up the Black Sea as a supply route for the Russian Empire, an indispensable ally in the British War effort. Before long, the British Royal Navy had sent tens of thousands of men, particularly from Australia and New Zealand, 
        to the Gallipoli Peninsula. Initially, they attempted to swiftly force themselves through the Dardanelles Strait, hitting the Ottoman capital of Constantinople, but this attempt failed due to heavy mining of the strait, and British forces 
        resolved to attempt an amphibious assault on the heart of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
        <p>With overall command given to Sir Ian Hamilton, overseen by Earl Herbert Kitchener, British forces landed at Gallipoli, particularly around ANZAC Cove and Cape Helles in late April 1915. Though British officials were initially 
        optimistic about the outcome of the theater, given the weakened state of the Ottoman Empire in the 20th century, any assumption of an imminent Ottoman collapse proved fantastical. Led by talented commanders such as Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, 
        the future founder of the Republic of Turkey, British forces quickly ran into fierce and determined Ottoman resistance. The campaign quickly devolved into a trench-ridden slog similar to other theaters in the First World War. Though hopes 
        of a swift breakthrough were dashed, British High Command poured reinforcements into the front, believing a breakthrough that could change the trajectory of the war was imminent.</p>
        <p>What ensued was a multi-months long bloodbath that tested the mettle and fortitude of men on both sides of the conflict. Though British forces, particularly those from Australia and New Zealand demonstrated extreme bravery and determination, 
        resistance by Ottoman forces proved an insurmountable obstacle. Repeated assaults proved fruitless, and as the months dragged on, British High Command soured on the prospects of the Gallipoli Campaign. Still, British forces kept fighting on 
        throughout 1915, even as they remained confined largely to a few coastlines secured by the initial landings. British and Ottoman forces attempted a series of offensives and counteroffensives, culminating in a large-scale offensive by British 
        forces in August of 1916.</p>
        <p>The August offensive was doomed to fail, however, and the British made little headway at the cost of extensive casualties. By this time, any realistic chance of a breakthrough by the British seemed to have entirely vanished, 
        and in its place only offered the opportunity for a bloody slog, similar to the other fronts in the First World War. With any chance of swift victory gone and negative press coverage of the campaign increasing, British High Command chose 
        to cut their losses and initiate a complex evacuation maneuver, aborting the Gallipoli Campaign. Many in the military, including Sir Ian Hamilton strenuously objected to the idea, but Hamilton was replaced by an officer more open to the idea.
        By January 1916, the evacuation was complete and the Gallipoli Campaign was effectively over.</p>
        <p>The Gallipoli Campaign’s legacy is rather difficult to parse. To the British, it was a debacle, one that killed tens of thousands of desperately needed men, nearly ended Winston Churchill’s career, and further disillusioned a public
        already reeling from having to process the brutal stalemate on the Western Front. To the Ottoman Empire on the other hand, it was one last great achievement of a dying state, and provided a launching pad for the person who would
        write the next chapter of Turkish history: Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. To the people who fought the campaign, Gallipoli was a folly, a gamble, a defense of the motherland, a chance at glory, and so much more. Through parsing Sir Ian Hamilton’s 
        diaries, you will inevitably see the complex realities of the campaign and the people who fought in it, largely through the eyes of the man who was perhaps most responsible for the campaign’s day-to-day execution. </p>
