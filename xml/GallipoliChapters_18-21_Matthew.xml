<p>_25th August, 1915. <location island="Imbros"> Imbros </location> <person name="Davies">Davies</person>left for <location country="Greece">Helles</location> at mid-day. Was to
have gone with <person name="Davies">him</person> but heard that <person name="Bailloud">Bailloud</person> with <person name="Lapruin">Captain Lapruin</person> would
like to see me, so stayed to receive them.</p>
  
<p>Have got <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">K.'s</person> answer to my cable pointing out the probable results of
<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person> declared intention of sending us no "reinforcements of importance"
during an indeterminate period.</p>
  
<p>"(No. 7315, cipher). From <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Earl Kitchener</person> to <person name="Ian_Hamilton">General Sir Ian Hamilton.
</person><person name="Ian_Hamilton">Your</person> No. 578. You will, <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">I</person> hope, fully discuss the situation described by
you with <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdwood</person> and the Generals who have just joined you, and, when a
thorough examination on the ground of the whole state of affairs has
been made, give <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">me</person> the opinion at which you arrive.</p>
  
<p>"It has been a sad disappointment to <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">me</person> that the troops have not been
able to do better, and that the drafts and reinforcements sent out to
<person name="Ian_Hamilton">you</person> and <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>, excluding any you have drawn from <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>, amounting from
6th August to 47,000, have not proved sufficient to enable you to
contemplate holding your positions."</p>
  
<p><person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person> and I have been electrified by this reference to 47,000
drafts and reinforcements: it is so much Greek to us here: had there
been any question of reinforcements coming to us on that scale, my 578
of 23rd August would never have been sent.</p>
  
<p>On the heels of this has followed another:--</p>
  
<p>"(No. 7319, cipher). From <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Earl Kitchener</person> to General <person name="Ian_Hamilton">Sir Ian Hamilton.</person> My
No. 7315. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">I</person> hope that the result of <person name="Ian_Hamilton">your</person> deliberations will reach <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">me</person> by
Friday morning, as the decision to be taken is one of considerable
importance."</p>
  
<p><person name="Herbert_Kitchener">I</person> have replied off the reel:--</p>
  
<p>"(No. M.F. 588). From <person name="Ian_Hamilton">General Sir Ian Hamilton</person> to <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Earl Kitchener.</person> With
reference to your telegrams Nos. 7315 and 7319. I feel sure you cannot
think I would be capable of sending a telegram of such import as my No.
M.F. 578 without the deepest consideration and sense of my personal
responsibility which remains unaffected by any amount of conferences
with my subordinate commanders. I was careful in this instance, however,
to discuss the situation on the spot with both Corps Commanders
concerned and I then cabled <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">you</person> my considered opinion. I constantly
visit both <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> and <location bay="Anzac">Anzac</location> and have personally thoroughly examined the
state of affairs. In view of your telegram No. 7172, cipher, I do not
understand <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">your</person> allusion to 47,000 drafts and reinforcements from 6th
August as we have not been advised of any such number as 47,000. I felt
bound to lay the case plainly before <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">you</person> as to what might have to be
undertaken, though I do not contemplate giving up any position one hour
before I need. If the present wastage from sickness continues, however,
and if my cadres are allowed to fall below their present attenuated
strength I may be compelled to undertake such a step as I have
indicated."</p>

<p><person name="Bailloud">Bailloud</person> arrived at tea time. Away from <location town="Piépape">Piépape</location> <person name="Bailloud">he</person> is another person. At
dinner, <person name="Bailloud">he</person> cracked jokes even about serious things like the guns of
Asia.</p>

<p><person name="Brodrick">Brodrick</person> was carried off to the Hospital ship. The doctors think there
should be no real danger. We shall all miss <person name="Brodrick">him</person> very much; as an aide <person name="Brodrick">he</person>
has been A.1.; sympathetic and thoughtful.</p>

<p>_26th August, 1915._ After clearing my table and taking early lunch,
started off in the <location ship="H.M.S. Arno">_Arno_</location> with C.G.S., <person name="Cpt.Pollen">Pollen</person>, <person name="Freddie">Freddie</person> and <person name="Val">Val.</person> Sailed
for <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> and went up straight to see <person name="Gen.Byng">Byng</person>, brought by the whirl of
Fortune's wheel from a French chateau to a dugout. During the two days
<person name="Gen.Byng">he</person> has been here, <person name="Gen.Byng">he</person> has been working very hard. I hope <person name="Gen.Byng">he</person> may not too
regretfully look back towards _la belle <location country="France">France</location>_. Our old "A" Beach was
being briskly shelled as we walked down to our boats. Between <location mountain="Hill 10">Hill 10</location>
and the sea there were salvoes of shrapnel falling and about every
thirty seconds a big fellow, probably a six incher, made a terrible
hullaballoo. The men working at piling up stores "carried on."</p>

<p>[Illustration: GENERAL BAILLOUD _"Exclusive News" phot._]</p>

<p>When we got back to G.H.Q. there was a heavy thunderstorm in progress.
Mail bag closed 9.30.</p>

<p>During our inspection at <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> this "Personal" from <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">K.</person> to myself has
been deciphered:--</p>



<p>"(No. 7337, cipher). From <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Earl Kitchener</person> to General <person name="Ian_Hamilton">Sir Ian Hamilton.</person>
Personal. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">I</person> considered it advisable, that as the decision the Government
may have to come to on <person name="Ian_Hamilton">your</person> No. 578 is one of grave importance, the
Generals out there should previously fully consider the situation on the
<location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location>">; hence <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">my</person> No. 7315. It was intended to obviate any
possibility of overlooking points and in such cases two or more heads
sometimes elucidate matters that might otherwise be missed or not given
due weight to. It was in no way intended thereby to detract from the
importance of <person name="Ian_Hamilton">your</person> views on the subject or to minimise <person name="Ian_Hamilton">your</person> personal
responsibility for them.</p>

<p>"<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">I</person> have no idea of the French Generals' views on the matter, and <person name="Ian_Hamilton">you</person>
were apparently not fully considering the drafts and reinforcements that
were being sent out.</p>

<p>"A detailed telegram is being sent <person name="Ian_Hamilton">you</person> from the office of the 47,000 men
mentioned in <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">my</person> No. 7315.</p>

<p>"<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">I</person> hope that the return of <unit type="brigade">Younghusband's Brigade</unit> from <location town="Aden">Aden</location> to <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>
will still further increase these in a day or two (less one battalion).</p>

<p>"But <person name="Ian_Hamilton">you</person> should look on the forces in <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> and <person name="Ian_Hamilton">your</person> own as a whole,
allowing, of course, for the proper defence of <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>, when you take the
general situation at the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> into consideration.</p>

<p>"Do <person name="Ian_Hamilton">you</person> think the Navy could do anything more than they are already
doing to help the situation? <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">I</person> hear it is thought that they could land
heavy naval 6-inch guns on positions such as those in square 92 M and
other points, and might threaten from <location town="Aja Liman">Aja Liman</location> the main road of <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location>
supplies between <location town="Karna Bili">Karna Bili</location> and <location town="Solvili">Solvili</location>(by gunfire from ships) and also
bring a heavy and effective shell fire on the <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> positions at and
behind <location town="Anafarta">Anafarta</location>. There is a cabinet to-morrow."</p>

<p><person name="Herbert_Kitchener">I</person> would much like to sleep over this cable--so plain seemingly; really
so obscure. At face value, how splendidly it simplifies the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location>
problem! Had <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">I</person> been, all along, as this cable seems to make <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">me</person>, the
C.-in-C. of the Eastern Mediterranean with <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person> administering <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">my</person>
<location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>ian Base, then, humanly speaking, this entry would have been dated
from <location town="Constantinople">Constantinople.</location> But am <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">I?</person> <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">I</person> can't believe it even now, with the
words before <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">me</person>. Anyway, whether by <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">my</person> own fault or those of others, one
thing is certain, namely, that up to date there has been
misunderstanding. Now, the Cabinet of to-morrow forces <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">me</person> to send a
momentous wire without too much time to think it over. To clear <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">my</person> brain
let <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">me</person> set down the sequence of facts as they have so far appeared to
<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">me</person>:--</p>



<p>Less than a week ago--20th inst.<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">--K.</person> cables me <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> is sending certain
units to <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> and certain other units to the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles.</location> The units and
their ships are named. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">He</person> says there is going to be a big push in
<location country="France">France</location> and that I must look to these troops, earmarked for the
<location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles,</location> plus any I "can obtain from <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>" to carry on. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">He</person> winds up
by saying, "It is hoped the troops going to <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> will enable <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person> to
send <person name="Ian_Hamilton">you</person> more fighting men on <person name="Ian_Hamilton">your</person> demand."</p>

<p>This same assumption that the G.O.C., <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>, and <person name="Ian_Hamilton">myself</person> are two equals
each having equal command over his own troops, is fully borne out by
another cable of the 21st August. My cable of 23rd August is based on
these messages; i.e. on the idea that we must carry on here for a good
long time to come with very little to help us. Then comes <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">K.'s</person> of the
25th telling me <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> is sorry 47,000 drafts and reinforcements <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> has sent
to <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person> and <person name="Ian_Hamilton">myself</person> since 6th August are not going to be enough to
enable me to hold on. But no one can make head or tail of these 47,000
drafts and reinforcements; no one can run them to ground. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">He</person> has
notified me the units and the ships, but the total coming to <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person>
_and_ <person name="Ian_Hamilton">myself</person> don't tot up to that figure, much less the portion of them
detailed for the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles.</location>[11] Now comes to-day's cable in which
<location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> is spoken of as being mine, and the fatness thereof. Taking this
message _per se_, any one might imagine I could draw any troops I liked
from that country provided that <person name="Ian_Hamilton">_I_</person> thought <person name="Ian_Hamilton">_I_</person> was leaving enough to
defend the Suez Canal: and, apparently, the 47,000 men are about to
make an effort to materialize inasmuch as we are told that details are
being wired us. Finally, <unit type="brigade">Younghusband's Brigade</unit> sails to help us!</p>
</entry>

<entry>
<p>_27th August, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros._</location> As there is a Cabinet to-day I had to get
off my answer last night. In it I have made a desperate effort to
straighten out the tangle:--</p>



<p>"(No. M.F. 589). From <person name="Ian_Hamilton">General Sir Ian Hamilton</person> to <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Earl Kitchener.</person> On
returning from <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> I have just found <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">your</person> No. 7337, cipher. I hope
there may be no misunderstanding as to meaning or intention of my No.
M.F. 578. I asked in my No. M.F. 562 for such drafts and reinforcements
as I considered necessary for the campaign to be brought to a conclusion
before the winter began. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">You</person> told me in <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">your</person> No. 7172 that you could
spare no more reinforcements beyond those mentioned therein, and that if
I could not achieve success with these I must remain on the defensive
for some considerable time. I explained situation in my No. M.F. 578,
and said that the question was one of arithmetic and measurement. I was
anxious to hold all I had got and to gain more, but I required all my
available force at the present time merely to hold what I had got. I
pointed out that meanwhile a large proportion of my troops were urgently
in need of rest, and sickness was so great that unless reinforcements
were sent out my force would soon be too small for the number of yards
of front to be held. In that case, i.e., if reinforcements could not be
spared, but in that case only, it would be necessary to contract my
line. This welcome news of 47,000 reinforcements, however, alters the
whole situation. Such a number will do much to complete my diminished
cadres, and should materially lessen sick rate by giving more chance of
taking tired troops out of the trenches. <person name="Gen.Byng">Byng</person> can certainly remain where
<person name="Gen.Byng">he</person> is at present, and will even be able to rest some of the tired <unit type="division">XXIXth Division</unit>, while the arrival of the <location country="Australia">Australia</location> Brigade will give <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">General
Birdwood</person> a similar chance of resting some of <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">his</person> troops.</p>

<p>"<person name="Cpt.Birdwood">General Birdwood</person> meanwhile is to make a further advance to-morrow on
the left flank, to gain possession of important tactical feature, which
will eventually help an advance when the time arrives. <person name="Gen.Byng">Byng</person> is getting
everything in order and has infected all around <person name="Gen.Byng">him</person> with <person name="Gen.Byng">his</person> own energy
and cheeriness and has quickly grasped the whole situation.</p>

<p>"In communication with <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person> I find I can have seven Territorial Force
units and the Scottish Horse, and now I have your welcome news of
<unit type="brigade">Younghusband's Brigade.</unit> Please believe I am the last man in the world to
give up anything we have gained except under direct necessity, which I
trust may now never arise. The Navy is supporting me to its full
capacity. The guns of the four ships in <location bay="Suvla">Suvla Bay</location> take on the <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location>
positions you mention almost as well as and certainly more safely than
if they were landed and placed where you suggest. Moreover, Navy cannot
lend those guns unless I supply the detachments to work them from the
Naval Division, and the latter is fully employed at present and cannot
spare the men. We are constantly sending ships round to <location town="Aja Liman">Aja Liman</location> to
fire at enemy positions from there, but I know you realize that one must
not rely too much upon effective fire on land targets from ships which
are not moored, as is the case in <location bay="Suvla">Suvla Bay.</location></p>

<p>"I have not consulted the French General about the situation in the
North as he is at the Southern end and on the right of the line there.
He thinks more of Asia than of these operations in which he has no
troops engaged, but I discussed the matter with him only last night.
Before I sent my No. M.F. 578 I discussed every point closely for two
hours with the Corps Commanders."</p>

<p>In the evening my A.G. brought me the promised details of the 47,000
drafts and reinforcements. He has gone into the detail in proper A.G.
spirit, namely, as an arithmetician rather than a tactician. The result
has given us a shock! 10,000 men of the <unit type="division">54th Division</unit> and 4,000 drafts
are shown in the War Office cable as being still due to come to me as
reinforcements whereas they had actually landed on the <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location>"; had,
indeed, been shown in my total fighting strength of 68,000 in my
original cable, M.F. 578 of 23rd August, and are, too many of them, alas
already _hors de combat_. Here is the passage sent four days ago:--"The
total casualties including sick since 6th August amount to 40,000, and
my total force is now only 85,000 of which the fighting strength is
68,000." In this 68,000 were included 14,000 of the men shown in
_subsequent_ War Office cables as being drafts and reinforcements on
their way to the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles!</location></p>

<p>So my A.G. has become a bit suspicious about the balance of the 47,000.
On paper, he says, it looks as if I might expect to draw from <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> and
<location country="England">England</location> 30,000 reinforcements, but--he remarks sententiously--"we know
by now that paper is one thing and men are different." As to
<unit type="brigade">Younghusband's Brigade</unit>, it turns out they cannot be employed here: too
many Mahomedans. Have sent the following reply:--</p>



<p>"(No. M.F. 595). From <person name="Ian_Hamilton">General Sir Ian Hamilton</person> to Secretary of State for
War. With reference to your telegram No. 7337, cipher. Have now received
details of the 47,000 drafts and reinforcements in your No. 7354 cipher,
and I find that this figure includes nearly 10,000 men of the LIVth
Division and 4,234 drafts, all of whom had been landed on the peninsula
when I wrote my No. M.F. 578, and were reckoned in the total fighting
strength of 68,000 mentioned in that telegram. The statement, however,
shows that I can expect from <location country="England">England</location> and <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> during the next six weeks
a total of some 29,000 reinforcements, including new formations and two
battalions of non-fighting lines of communication troops.</p>

<p>"This is a better situation than I was led by your 7172, cipher, to
expect, and you may rely on me to do the best I can with this addition
to my present very depleted strength. I hope, however, you realize that
whereas my <location country="England">British</location> Divisions are now more than 55,000 rifles below their
establishment only 17,000 of these 29,000 are drafts, and before the
last of the drafts can arrive these divisions will have lost another 25
per cent. of their remaining number by normal wastage.</p>

<p>"In regard to <unit type="brigade">Younghusband's Brigade</unit>, I learn that the three battalions
are practically half Mahomedans, and I am advised that it is better if
it can be avoided not to use Mahomedans so near the heart of Islam.
Would it not be possible to exchange these for some Hindu regiments in
<location country="France">France</location>?"</p>

<p>These cables give us an uncomfortable feeling that the people at home
wish to regard us as stronger than we are--a different thing from
wishing to add to our strength.</p>

<p>On the other hand, another sort of message has come in which sheds a ray
of hope across our path so darkened at many other points:--</p>

<p>"(No 7372, cipher). From <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Earl Kitchener</person> to <person name="Ian_Hamilton">General Sir Ian Hamilton.</person>
Although it is understood that we do not at present see our way to
change the recent decision not to send any fresh complete divisional
units, we wish to have all the material possible on which to form a
judgment from time to time. Therefore, will <person name="Ian_Hamilton">you</person> please telegraph <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">me</person> <person name="Ian_Hamilton">your</person>
opinion, from the point of view of the military and strategical
situation now existing on the peninsula, as to the prospects there are,
after the experience <person name="Ian_Hamilton">you</person> have recently had, of our achieving the main
objective of turning the Turks out and what force <person name="Ian_Hamilton">you</person> would consider
would be required to do this."</p>

<p><person name="Taylor">Taylor of the G.S.</person> lunched. A big parcel mail came in. <person name="Brodrick">Brodrick</person> is to be
sent to <location city="Alexandria">Alexandria.</location></p>

<entry>
<p>_28th August, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros._</location> <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person> and I both feel we must take
  time to think over last night's last cable and I have wired to say so.</p>

<p><person name="Cox">Cox's</person> attack on Knoll 60 to the North-east of <location mountain="Kaiajik Aghala">Kaiajik Aghala</location> came off
well. The <location country="New Zealand">New Zealanders</location> under <person name="Russell">Russell</person> and the Connaught Rangers did
brilliantly. Fighting is still going on.</p>

<p>A reply from the War Office to mine of last week wherein I pointed out
that the once splendid <unit type="battalion">5th Battalion Royal Scots</unit> had fallen from a
strength of 1,000 down to 289. They have had no one since the campaign
began. To-day the Battalion is just over 250--a Company! Now I am
officially told that "no reinforcements can be found for the 1/5th
Battalion of Royal Scots." This is the Battalion which did so well about
11 o'clock on the dreadful night of the 2nd May. I shall cable the <person name="Lord_Provost">Lord
Provost of Edinburgh.</person> If we could get into touch with the human beings
of Edinburgh they would help us to keep a battalion like the <unit type="battalion">Royal Scots</unit>
on their legs even if they had to break up half a dozen new formations
for the purpose.</p>

<p><person name="Freddie">Freddie</person> and I dined with <person name="John_de_Robeck">de Robeck</person> on board <location ship="H.M.S. Triad"> H.M.S. _Triad_.</location> The V.A. was
well pleased with my cable of the 26th.</p>
</entry>

<entry>
<p>_29th August, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros._</location> Last night two cables:--</p>



<p>"(No. 7414, cipher. C.I.G.S.). From War Office to General Headquarters,
Mediterranean Expeditionary Force. Reference your No. M.F.Q.T. 2737.
The two Territorial Force battalions originally detailed--_see_ my No.
7172 of 20th August--to sail in the <location ship="H.M.S. Orsova">_Orsova_</location> will be taken by the
<location ship="H.M.S. Ceramic">_Ceramic_.</location> Of these, the 2/5th Devons is only about 700 strong and
contains a large percentage of recruits, while the 1/6th Royal Scots
contains about 40 per cent. partially trained men and a new Commanding
Officer who has only just been appointed. Until it has had further
training neither battalion is fit for anything more than garrison duty.
I suggest that under these circumstances the <location ship="H.M.S. Ceramic">_Ceramic_</location> should proceed
direct to <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>."</p>

<p>"(No. 7401, cipher, 554/A.3.). From War Office to Inspector-General of
Communications, Mediterranean Expeditionary Force. We are receiving from
<location country="Malta">Malta</location> and <location city="Alexandria">Alexandria</location> very large demands for materials and explosives for
making grenades. The supply of these seriously interferes with our
manufacture of grenades. At present we are hoping to send you 30 to
40,000 grenades weekly and this figure will be increased. When the
materials already sent out to <location country="Malta">Malta</location> and <location city="Alexandria">Alexandria</location> have been used up,
can the manufacture of grenades at those places cease? Please repl/y at
once; the matter is urgent."</p>

<p>Do what I will my pen carries me away and I find myself writing like an
ill-conditioned "grouser." As an old War Office "hand" I ought to
know--and I do know--the frightful time of stress under which Whitehall
labours. But, just look at these two cables, you innocent and peaceful
citizen of a thousand years hence! The residue of the famous 47,000
rifles sent me by the Adjutant-General are now being valued by the
official valuer, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. In all our
calculations the 2/5th Devons has hitherto masqueraded as an efficient
battalion at full strength. Figures are sometimes more eloquent than
words!</p>

<p>As to the second cable, that deals us a worse blow. Seeing clearly, at
last, we should extract no hand grenades from the War Office, we turned
to <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person> and <person name="Metheun">Methuen,</person> who have interested themselves in our plight and
have been making us so many that, with what we ourselves can add to
their manufacture, we are at last beginning to make things hum in the
<location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> trenches. Then in comes this War Office cable to crush our
nascent industry and give us in exchange some pious aspirations.</p>

<p>There is no good making any trouble about the hand grenades. As to the
two raw battalions, I am asking they be sent, raw and weak as they are,
as I can train them in the trenches much better and more quickly than
they could be trained in <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> or <location country="England">England</location>.</p>

<p>Church Parade; office work; sailed over to "K" Beach; inspected Clearing
Stations and walked up to site for new camp. Then back to G.H.Q., to
meet the V.A. and <person name="Roger_Keyes">Roger Keyes.</person> They remain the best of friends always.</p>

<p>This evening we were all in good form owing to the news from <location bay="Anzac">Anzac.</location>
Knoll 60, now ours throughout, commands the Biyuk Anafarta valley with
view and fire--a big tactical scoop.</p>
</entry>

<entry>
<p>_30th August, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros._</location> Still good news from <location bay="Anzac">Anzac.</location> Seeing that the
stunt was on a small scale, we seem to have got into the Turks with a
vengeance. In falling back as well as in counter-attacking after we had
taken <location mountain="Hill 60">Hill 60</location>, the enemy were exposed to the fire from our trenches
along the Kaiajik Dere. Birdie declares that they have lost 5,000. We
have taken several machine guns and trench mortars as well as some fifty
prisoners. Have sent grateful message to all on the spot.</p>

<p>At 10.30 four Russian Officers made their salaams. They are to report
how things are going, and they seem to have the usual quick Slav faculty
for grasping essential points combined, no doubt, with the usual Slav
slackness which lets them go again. I told them everything I knew. They
told us that our landing had saved the whole Army of the Caucasus; that
the Grand Duke knew it and that His Imperial Highness bitterly regretted
that, first of all, sheer lack of supplies; afterwards the struggles in
Galicia and <location country="Poland">Poland</location>, had prevented <person name="Istomine">Istomine</person> and his Army Corps from
standing by to help.</p>

<p>At 1.30 the C.G.S., <person name="Deedes">Deedes</person>, <person name="Val.">Val.,</person> <person name="Freddy">Freddy</person> and I crossed to <location country="Greece">Helles</location> in the
<location ship="H.M.S. Arno">_Arno_.</location> Had a hard afternoon's walking, going first to 8th Corps
Headquarters; next to the Royal Naval Division and last to the 52nd
Divisional Headquarters. Returned to the 8th Corps Headquarters and
there met <person name="Bailloud">Bailloud.</person> <person name="Bailloud">He</person> is now full of good cheer. Got back to
Headquarters without adventure or misadventure.</p>

<p>Have cabled home a suggestion made to me by <person name="Mahon">Mahon</person>, that the <unit type="division">16th Irish
Division</unit> at home might be used to fill up the gaps in the units of the

<entry>
<p>_31st August, 1915._ After early lunch, left in the <location ship="H.M.S. Arno">_Arno_</location> for <location bay="Suvla">Suvla.</location> With
me were <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person>, <person name="Manifold">Manifold</person>, <person name="Freddy">Freddy</person> and <person name="Val.">Val.</person> Walked up to the 9th
Corps Headquarters and saw <person name="Gen.Byng">Byng.</person> I am very anxious indeed <person name="Gen.Byng">he</person> should work
<person name="Gen.Byng">his</person> men up into the mood for making a push. <person name="Gen.Byng">He</person> charms everyone and <person name="Gen.Byng">he</person> is
fast pulling <person name="Gen.Byng">his</person> force together. <person name="Maude">Maude,</person> <person name="Fanshawe">Fanshawe,</person> and <person name="de_Lisle">de Lisle</person> seem to
be keen to do something, but <person name="Gen.Byng">Byng,</person> though <person name="Gen.Byng">he</person> also is keen, has the
French standards for ammunition in <person name="Gen.Byng">his</person> head. <person name="Gen.Byng">He</person> does not think we have
enough to warrant us in making an attack. Also, <person name="Gen.Byng">he</person> does not realize yet
that if <person name="Gen.Byng">he</person> is going to wait until we are fitted out on that scale <person name="Gen.Byng">he</person>
will have to wait till doomsday.</p>

<p>Walked to <person name="de_Lisle">de Lisle's</person> Headquarters and saw <person name="de_Lisle">him</person>, and on to the 11th
Divisional Headquarters where I met <person name="Fanshawe">Fanshawe</person> and <person name="Malcolm">Malcolm.</person> With them I
climbed back on to <location mountain="Karakol Dagh">Karakol Dagh</location> and sat me down on the identical same
stone whereon I sweated blood during that confused and indecisive battle
of the 21st August. From the <location mountain="Karakol Dagh">Karakol Dagh</location> I got a very fair idea of our
whole trench system. On either flank we hold the hills; elsewhere we are
on the flat. <unit type="division">The 11th Division</unit> have recovered and only need drafts to be
as good a formation as any General could wish to command. In the evening
I left in the <location ship="H.M.S. Arno">_Arno_</location> carrying off with me <person name="de_Lisle">de Lisle</person> and <person name="Hardress_Lloyd">Captain Hardress
Lloyd</person> to dine and stay the night. <person name="Quentin_Agnew">Quentin Agnew</person> also dined.</p>

<p>My first feeble little attempt to act on <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">K.'s</person> assumption that <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> and
its army are mine has fallen a bit flat. The War Office promptly agreed
to my taking these two weak, half-trained battalions, the and <unit type="battalion">2/5th Devons,</unit> to be trained in my trenches. That was
yesterday. But the Senoussi must have heard of it at once, for <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person>
forthwith cables, "The attitude of the Senoussi is distinctly dangerous
and his people have been latterly executing night manoeuvres round our
post at <location town="Sollum">Sollum.</location>" To <person name="Ian_Hamilton">me,</person> the night manoeuvres of these riff-raff seem
ridiculous. But distance, perhaps, has lent its enchantment to my view.</p>

<p>The quibble that the troops in <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> are mine has been broken to pieces
by my first touch! I have renounced the two battalions with apologies
and now I daresay the Senoussi will retire from his night manoeuvres
round <location town="Sollum">Sollum</location> and resume his old strategic position up <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell's</person> sleeve.</p>

<entry>
<p>_1st September, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros._ </location>Remained at Headquarters working. Wrote,
amongst other things, to <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">K.</person> as follows:--</p>



<p>"I have just finished two days' hard physical exercise going round
visiting <location town="Egerton">Egerton</location> and <location town="Paris">Paris</location> with <person name="Davies">Davies,</person> and <person name="Fanshawe">Fanshawe</person> and <person name="de_Lisle">de Lisle</person> with
<person name="Gen.Byng">Byng.</person> At <location country="Greece">Helles</location> everything is quite right although they have only troops
enough there for the defensive. They are getting a lot of stores in,
and the really only anxious feature of the situation is the health of
the men who are very, very tired right through, having had no sort of
relief for months, and who go sick in large numbers.</p>



<p>"<person name="Fanshawe">Fanshawe</person> is first class. Full of go and plans, <person name="Fanshawe">he</person> will, if the Lord
spares him, be a real treasure. <person name="Maude">Maude</person> and <person name="Mahon">Mahon</person> I am going to see after
Mail-day, and then I shall hope to inspect our new captured position on
the left of <location bay="Anzac">Anzac.</location></p>

<p>"I do not know if they showed you the cable saying <person name="Hammersley">Hammersley</person> has gone
home very ill with a clot of blood in his leg. <person name="Hammersley">He</person> has to lie perfectly
prostrate and still, so I am told, as the least movement might set it
loose and it would then kill <person name="Hammersley">him.</person> Evidently <person name="Hammersley">he</person> was not really fit to
have been sent out on service. And this was the man, remember, on whom,
under <person name="Stopford">Stopford,</person> everything depended for making a push.</p>

<p>"This <location bay="Suvla">Suvla Bay</location> country, a jungle ringed round by high mountains, is
essentially a country for Boers or for <location country="India">Indian</location> troops. <person name="de_Lisle">De Lisle</person> and
others who have watched them closely in India, say that a native soldier
on the <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location> (although there, too, he goes to pieces if he loses his
Officers and under too prolonged a strain) is worth at least two <location country="India">Indian</location>
soldiers in <location country="France">France</location>. The climate suits him better, but, most of all, the
type of enemy is more or less the sort of type they are accustomed to
encounter. Not _Sahibs_ and _Ghora Log_ in helmets but _Mussalman Log_
in turbans. As to the South Africans, there can be no two opinions, I
think, that they would stand these conditions better than those of
Northern Europe. Indeed, we have one or two Boers serving now with the
<location country="Australia">Australians,</location> and they have done extremely well."</p>

<p>Some of <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">K.'s</person> questions take my breath away. I wish very much indeed <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person>
could come and spend a week with <person name="Ian_Hamilton">me.</person> Otherwise I feel hopeless of making
<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">him</person> grasp the realities of the trenches. On the 30th of August <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person>
cables, "If required, I could send you a fresh consignment of junior
Officers. Or have you sufficient supernumerary Officers to fill all
casualties?" I have replied to <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">him</person> that, in my four regular Divisions, I
am short of 900 effective Officers in the Infantry alone. To meet my
total shortage of 1,450 Officers I have twenty-five young gentlemen who
have lately been sent out here to complete their training!</p>

<p><person name="de_Lisle">De Lisle</person> and <person name="Hardress_Lloyd">Hardress Lloyd</person> sailed back to <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> in the evening.</p>

<entry>
<p>_2nd September, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ An ugly dream came to me last night. My
tent was at <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location> right enough, and I was lying in my little camp bed,
and yet I was being drowned, held violently under the <location country="Greece">Helles</location>pont.</p>

<p>The grip of a hand was still on my throat; the waters were closing over
my head as I broke away and found myself wide awake. I was trembling and
carried back with me into the realms of consciousness an idea that some
uncanny visitor had entered my tent. Already the vision was fading. I
could visualize the form of the presence, but the face remained hidden
in shadow. Never had I suffered from so fearful a dream. For hours
afterwards I was haunted by the thought that the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> were fatal;
that something sinister was a-foot; that we, all of us, were pre-doomed.</p>

<p>Dreams go by contraries. Strange that so black a night should be
followed by a noon so brilliant--so brilliant beyond compare.</p>

<p><person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> cables the French are going to send three or four Divisions to work
with us along the Asiatic mainland. From bankrupt to millionaire in 24
hours. The enormous spin of fortune's wheel makes me giddy!</p>

<p>These French Divisions will be real Divisions: _must_ be; they have no
others.</p>

<p>O, Hallelujah!</p>

<p>"The sending of a force of three or four Divisions to operate on the
Asiatic mainland, independent as regards command, but in close relation
with the <location country="England">British</location> forces on the <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Peninsula</location>, is being considered by the
French Government. They will require an exclusively French military base
at <location town="Mitylene">Mitylene</location>, and us to help with transport and fleet.</p>

<p>"So far I have not discussed any details with the French, and have
simply told them we shall be delighted to have the help, which would be
given by such an expedition, towards the solution of the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location>
problem.</p>

<p>"Presumably they would require their two divisions now at Cape <location country="Greece">Helles</location>.
What forces would you require to relieve them? I have asked Sir John
French if the <unit type="division">XXVIIth</unit> and <unit type="division">XXVIIIth</unit> Divisions could be spared for this
purpose.</p>

<p>"Wire me any points that you think I had better settle with the French
authorities."</p>

<p>_Deo volente_ we are saved; <location town="Constantinople">Constantinople</location> is doomed. How clearly stand
forth the mosques and minarets of the Golden Horn.</p>

<p>Mr.<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person>, an <location country="Australia">Australia</location> journalist, paid me a visit to thank me for
having stretched a point in <person name="Murdoch">his</person> favour by letting <person name="Murdoch">him</person> see the
<location peninsula="Gallipoli">Peninsula.</location> Seemed a sensible man.</p>

<p><person name="Glyn">Glyn</person> and <person name="Holdich">Holdich</person> dined: both clever fellows in different ways. <person name="Dawnay">Dawnay</person>
and <person name="Glyn">Glyn</person> after dinner left for <location country="England">England</location>. <person name="Dawnay">Dawnay</person> goes to explain matters
first hand to <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> Next to my going home myself, or to <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> himself coming
out here, this is the best I can do. <person name="Dawnay">Dawnay</person> is one of the soundest young
officers we have, but <person name="Dawnay">he</person> is run down physically (like most of us) and
jaded. <person name="Dawnay">He</person> should benefit by the trip and so should the rumour-mongers at
home.</p>

<p>_3rd September, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ Two cables: one to say that the news
about the French Divisions must be kept dark; the other, in reply to a
question by me, refusing to let me consult <person name="John_de_Robeck">de Robeck</person> on the matter. So
<person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person> and I had to make out our cable expressing our delight and
thankfulness, and advising how the troops might best be used entirely on
our own.</p>

<p>The cable took some doing but got it off my chest by mid-day and then
sailed with <person name="Ellison">Ellison</person>, <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person> and <person name="Val">Val</person> by the <location ship="H.M.S. Arno">_Arno_</location> to <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location>. We
landed this time on Lala Baba instead of at our usual Ghazi Baba. Every
five minutes the Turks plumped one six-incher on to the beach. But
nobody now seems to mind. A lot of Generals present; <person name="Gen.Byng">Byng</person>, <person name="Mahon">Mahon</person>,
<person name="Marshall">Marshall</person>, <person name="Maude">Maude</person> and <person name="Peyton">Peyton</person>. <person name="Mahon">Mahon</person> took me up to the top of Lala Baba and
showed me the disposition of <person name="Mahon">his</person> division. <person name="Mahon">He</person> kindly asked us all to tea
at <person name="Mahon">his</person> Headquarters but as someone added that <person name="Ashmead_Bartlett">Ashmead-Bartlett</person> was
going to take a cinema photo of the scene I thought I would not be thus
immortalized. The Scottish Horse were bivouacking on the beach; they
have just landed but already they have lost a member or two of their
Mess from shell fire. No wonder they looked a little bewildered, but
soon they will shake down. When we got back to the <location ship="H.M.S. Arno">_Arno_</location> we found she
had been hit by shrapnel, but no damage.</p>

<p>Things at <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> are pulling together. No one gave me more confidence
than <person name="Maude">Maude</person>. <person name="Maude">His</person> mind travels beyond the needs of the moment. <person name="Maude">He</person> is
firmly convinced that no very out-of-the-way effort by the Allies is
needed to score a big point in the War Game and that our hold-up here is
not a reality but only a hold-up or petrefaction of the brains of the
French and of our <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> Committee. I longed to tell him <person name="Maude">he</person> was
doing them both, especially the French, an injustice, and that four
splendid divisions were as good as on their way, but I had to content
myself with saying to <person name="Maude">him</person> and to all the Generals that I was overjoyed
at a piece of news received yesterday.</p>

<p>_4th September, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ Life would be as ditchwater were it not
stirred to its depths by <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person>'s secret cable. Sailed over with <person name="Freddie">Freddie</person> at
11.30 to "K" Beach and inspected the <unit type="brigade">88th Brigade.</unit> Had given orders to
the <location ship="H.M.S. Arno">_Arno_</location> to stand by and to take me over to <location bay="Anzac">Anzac</location> in the afternoon,
but the weather was so bad that I could not get off to her in the motor
boat.</p>

<p>At 7.15 p.m. the V.A. sent his picket boat for me and <person name="Freddie">Freddie</person> and I went
on board the _<location ship="H.M.S. Triad">Triad</location>_. At 10 p.m. <location ship="H.M.S. Triad">she</location> started for <location town="Mudros">Mudros</location>.</p>
</entry>

<entry>
<p>_5th September, 1915. H.M.S. "<location ship="H.M.S. Triad">Triad</location>." <location town="Mudros">Mudros</location>._ Anchored at <location town="Mudros">Mudros</location> at 6
a.m. Breakfast over, was met by <person name="Altham">Altham</person>, <person name="McMunn">Colonel McMunn</person> and <person name="Stephens">Captain
Stephens</person> who took me ashore. There I met <person name="Lindley">Lindley</person>, now commanding the
troops on the island; also General <person name="Legge">Legge</person> (commanding the 2nd <location country="Australia">Australia</location>
Division); Lord <person name="Dudley">Dudley</person> and Colonel Forster. <person name="Lindley">Lindley</person> seems pleased at
having been given this command; says <person name="Lindley">he</person> feels like a man out hunting who
has a bad fall but alights on <person name="Lindley">his</person> feet, and <person name="Altham">Altham</person> tells me <person name="Lindley">he</person> is doing
the work very well. <person name="Dudley">Dudley</person>, too, seemed full of business and contented
with <person name="Dudley">his</person> lot.</p>

<p>The moment I got through the reception stunt I set myself to work like a
nigger at the Red Cross stunt:--that's how people talk now-a-days. Saw
the 15th Stationary Hospital; the 110th <location country="India">Indian</location> Field Ambulance; "C"
Section of No. 24 <location country="England">British</location> <location country="India">Indian</location> Hospital; ate a hearty lunch; inspected
1st <location country="Australia">Australia</location> Stationary Hospital. Walking round a Hospital and seeing
whether things are clean and bright is a treat but trying to cheer
people up and give a fillip to all good works--that implies an
expenditure of something vital and leaves a man, after a few hours,
feeling the worse for wear.</p>

<p>By 4.45 the day's task was well over so refreshed myself by some right
soldier business reviewing the 4th Gurkhas under <person name="Tillard">Major Tillard</person>--a
superb battalion--1,000 strong!!! Had forgotten what a full battalion
looks like. At 5.45 wound up by inspecting a huge Convalescent Depot
under Colonel Forde and got back to the _<location ship="H.M.S. Triad">Triad</location>_ just in time for dinner.
Wemyss dined also.</p>

<entry>
<p>_6th September, 1915. H.M.S. "<location ship="H.M.S. Triad">Triad</location>." <location town="Mudros">Mudros</location>._ After breakfast sailed
over to <location town="Mudros">Mudros</location> West; <person name="Lindley">Lindley</person> met me, also a host of doctors. Walked to
No. 3 <location country="Australia">Australia</location> Hospital with an old acquaintance whose Italian name
slips my memory at the moment; then to No. 2 <location country="Australia">Australia</location> Stationary
Hospital; then to Convalescent Depot of Lowland Division. At 12.30 ran
down to my launch and was swiftly conveyed to lunch on board the
_Europa_ with <person name="Wemyss">Admiral Wemyss</person>. Such a lunch as a lost voyager may dream
of in the desert. Like roses blooming in a snowdrift, so puffs and pies
and kickshaws of all rarest sorts appeared upon a dazzling white
tablecloth, and then--disappeared. We too had to disappear and sail back
to <location town="Mudros">Mudros</location> West again. Horses were waiting and I rode to No. 18
Stationary Hospital and made a thorough overhaul of it from end to end;
then tea with the Officers of No. 1. In No. 3 <location country="Australia">Australia</location> General were
eighty nurses; in No. 3 Canadian Stationary seven nurses; in No. 1
Canadian Stationary twenty-four nurses. Since Lady Brassey descended in
some miraculous manner upon <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>, they were the first white women I
had seen for six months. Their pretty faces were a refreshing sight: a
capable crowd too: all these Hospitals were in good order, but the sick
and wounded in charge of the girls looked the happiest--and no wonder.
The Canadian Medicos are fresh from <location country="France">France</location> and discoursed about
_moral_. Never a day passed, so they said, in <location country="France">France</location>, but some patient
would, with tears in his eyes, entreat to be sent home. Here at <location town="Mudros">Mudros</location>
there had never been one single instance. The patients, if they said
anything at all, have showed impatience to get back to their comrades in
the fighting line. We discussed this mystery at tea and no one could
make head or tail of it. In <location country="France">France</location> the men got a change; are pulled out
of the trenches; can go to cafes; meet young ladies; get drinks and
generally have a good time. On the Peninsula they are never safe for one
moment (whether they are supposed to be resting or are in the firing
line) from having their heads knocked off by a shell.</p>

<p>Returned to the _<location ship="H.M.S. Triad">Triad</location>_ in time for dinner.</p>

<p>Admiral vexed as his motor boat has gone ashore. <person name="Bowlby">Bowlby</person> is with it

<p>_8th September, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ Trying to clear a table blocked with
papers as a result of my two days' trip. Have written to <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> as the Mail
bag goes to-morrow. Have told him I have had a nice letter from <person name="Mahon">Mahon</person>,
thanking me for allowing <person name="Mahon">him</person> to rejoin <person name="Mahon">his</person> Division and saying <person name="Mahon">he</person> hopes
<person name="Mahon">he</person> may stay with them till the end. Have given <person name="Mahon">him</person> all my <location town="Mudros">Mudros</location> news
and have sent <person name="Mahon">him</person> a memo. submitted to me by <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdwood</person> showing how much
of the sickness on the <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Peninsula</location> seems due to the War Office having hung
up my first request for a Field Force Canteen.</p>

<p>Here is one of the enclosures to <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdwood's</person> memo.:--</p>



<p>  "N. Z. and A. Division.</p>

<p><person name="Cpt.Birdwood">I</person> desire to draw attention to the remarkable drop in the sick
evacuations from this Brigade as shown by the following figures:--</p>

<p>  August 28 -- 59.
     "   29 -- 64.
     "   30 -- 58.
     "   31 -- 17.
  Sept.   1 --  2.
     "    2 --  6.</p>

<p><person name="Cpt.Birdwood">I</person> am convinced that this amelioration, and the observable improvement in
the condition of the men are largely to be attributed to the
distribution, on August 30 and 31 of Canteen Stores, providing a welcome
change of dietary.</p>

<p><person name="Cpt.Birdwood">I</person> strongly recommend that every effort be made to maintain such Canteen
supplies.</p>

<p>A five course lunch and I had to make a speech in French.</p>

<p>When I got back I found that General <person name="Marshall">Marshall</person>, commanding the <unit type="division">53rd

<p>_10th September, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ <person name="Lancelot Lowther">Lancelot Lowther</person> left with the Mails at
7 a.m., glad, I suspect, to shake from <person name="Lancelot Lowther">his</person> feet the sand of these
barbaric Headquarters.</p>

<p>Not easy to get <person name="Marshall">Marshall</person> to loosen <person name="Marshall">his</person> tongue about the battle of the
21st, and <person name="Marshall">he</person> would not, or could not, add much to my knowledge. The
strength of <person name="Marshall">Marshall</person> depends not on what <person name="Marshall">he</person> seems but upon what <person name="Marshall">his</person>
officers and men know. <person name="Marshall">He</person> has got <person name="Marshall">his</person> chance amidst the realities of
war. In peace, except by a miracle, <person name="Marshall">he</person> would never have risen above the
command of a Battalion. The main reason I cannot draw him about the
battle of the 21st is, beyond doubt, that <person name="Marshall">he</person> does not want to throw
blame on others.</p>

<p><person name="Marshall">Marshall</person> is a matter-of-fact, unemotional sort of chap, yet <person name="Marshall">he</person> told the
sad tale of young <person name="O'Sullivan">O'Sullivan's</person> death in a way which touched our hearts.
<person name="O'Sullivan">O'Sullivan</person> was no novice where V.C.s were the stake and the forfeit
sudden death.</p>

<p>_11th September, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ Ran across in the motor boat to see the
86th Brigade under Brigadier-General <person name="Percival">Percival</person>. Went, man by man, down
the lines of the four battalions--no very long walk either! These were
the Royal Fusiliers (Major <person name="Guyon">Guyon</person>), Dublin Fusiliers (Colonel <person name="O'Dowda">O'Dowda</person>),
Munster Fusiliers (Major <person name="Geddes">Geddes</person>), Lancashire Fusiliers (Major <person name="Pearson">Pearson</person>).</p>

<p>Shade of Napoleon--say, which would you rather not have, a skeleton
Brigade or a Brigade of skeletons? This famous 86th Brigade is a
combination. Were I a fat man I could not bear it, but I am as
unsubstantial as they themselves. A life insurance office wouldn't touch
us; and yet--they kept on smiling!</p>

<p>_13th September, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ Crossed again with <person name="Freddie">Freddie</person> Maitland and
inspected the 87th Field Ambulance (Highland Territorials from <location town="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</location>)
under <person name="Fraser">"Colonel Fraser.</person> Became so interested the dinner hour was
forgotten--a bad mark for a General. Much pleased with the whole show:
up to date, and complete in all respects. Got back lateish. <person name="Altham">Altham</person>
dined. Sat up at business till midnight.</p>

<p>Dictated a long letter to <person name="Callwell">Callwell</person>, Director of Military Operations at
the War Office, on the suicidal behaviour of the Military Censor. In
<location country="South Africa">South Africa</location>, my Chief of the Staff's latchkey let many a clandestine
tit-bit slip through to keep interest alive in <location country="England">England</location>. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> regularly,
when the mails came back to roost, went for me, but the messages had got
home and done their duty as good little tit-bits should. The B.P. cannot
work up the full steam of their war energy when the furnaces of their
enthusiasms are systematically damped down; shut off from any breath
from outside. Your sealed pattern censor sees nothing beyond the
mischief that may happen if the enemy gets to know too much about us; he
does not see that this danger is negligible when compared with the
keenness or dullness of the nation.</p>

<p>                       General Headquarters,
                           Medtn. Expeditionary Force,
                                 13th September, 1915.</p>

<p>  "Dear <person name="Callwell">Callwell</person>,</p>

<p>"I am about to commit an atrocity by writing to an overworked man on a
subject which may seem to him of secondary importance. Still, to the
soldiers out here, the said subject means encouragement or
discouragement coming to them through the medium of their home
letters,--so vital a factor in victory or failure that the thought
emboldens me to proceed.</p>

<p>"Our misfire of last month came within only a fine hair's breadth of the
grand coup and caused us proportionately bitter disappointment at the
moment. Yet, looking back over the whole affair in a more calm and
philosophical spirit, any General, I think, would now be bound to admit
that in some respects at least fortune had not been too unkind.</p>

<p>"The <location country="Australia">Australians</location> and <location country="New Zealand">New Zealanders</location> have been extricated from what by
all the laws and traditions of war, was, in theory, an untenable
position; their borders have been enlarged; the heights they hold have
become more elevated and commanding; they have been entirely released
from shelling on the one flank and, on the other, the shelling has
dwindled away to next door to nothing. North of them again we have
captured a more or less practicable winter harbour, and have extended
our grip on the coastline. From the extreme South point of <location bay="Anzac">Anzacs</location> to
their extreme North was formerly 2-3/4 miles. From the extreme South
point of <location bay="Anzac">Anzacs</location> to our extreme North point (along which there is
inter-communication) is now 13 miles. Thus we force the enemy to
maintain a much larger number of troops on the <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Peninsula</location> (where he is
already slowly bleeding to death under the stress of his supply and
transport difficulties) or else dangerously to weaken parts of his line.</p>

<p>"As to the fighting by which this has been accomplished, there is
nothing from beginning to end that any army need be ashamed of. Every
word I sent home in my Proemial cables might have been published without
raising a blush to the cheek of the most ardent Imperialist. In saying
this I do not, of course, assume that raw troops could tackle a totally
strange and uncomfortable proposition with the swift directness and
savvy of veterans. The feat performed by the <location country="Australia">Australians</location> and New
Zealanders was of the class of the storming of the heights of Abraham,
only it was infinitely, infinitely more difficult in every respect.</p>

<p>"On the other side, still assuming the philosophical mantle, consider
what might have happened. Had the <location country="Australia">Australians</location> and <location country="New Zealand">New Zealanders</location> been
average troops, they would perhaps have burst through the first series
of wire entanglements and trenches, but they would not have stormed the
second, still less the third, fourth, fifth or sixth lines. Again, had
the Turks got the smallest inkling of our intention, the landing at
<location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay would have failed altogether, and the New Armies would have
been virtually smashed to pieces without being able to show any _quid
pro quo_.</p>

<p>"We soldiers out here have then it seems to me, much for which to thank
God on our bended knees. That, at least, is my personal attitude.</p>

<p>"How is it then that our letters from home are filled with lamentations
and that, having just gained a proportionately very large accretion of
territory, we see headlines in the papers such as 'The <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location>
standstill,' whereas it does not seem to occur to anyone to speak about
'The French standstill'?</p>

<p>"Well, I will tell you. The system upon which the Press Bureau
approaches the eagerly attentive ear of the <location country="England">British</location> Public is the
reason.</p>

<p>"Why I begged the War Office to change the method by which I sent copies
of my Proemial cables to <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person> was that I found <person name="Maxwell">he</person> (animated, of
course, by the best intentions) was improving the successes and
minimising the failures. The finishing touch was given when, one day, <person name="Maxwell">he</person>
inserted the phrase 'The enemy is demoralized and has to submit by day
and by night to our taking his trenches.' Obviously, even the most
stupid fellaheen after reading such a sentence must, in the course of
time, begin to ask himself how, if trenches are being easily taken by
day and by night, we still remain on the wrong side of <location heights="Achi Baba">Achi Baba</location>!</p>

<p>"Turning now to the Press Bureau and our landing, there was nothing in
that landing, as I have just said, which need have caused sorrow to a
soul in the <location country="England">British</location> Isles excepting, of course, the deplorable heavy
casualties which are inseparable now from making any attack. But, on the
23rd of August a correspondent cables to an American paper a sensational
story of a decisive victory, which the Press Bureau must have known to
be a tissue of lies. Had the lies taken the shape of disasters to the
<location country="England">British</location> there would not, from the point of view of us soldiers, have
been the smallest objection to publishing them. Suppose Mr. X, for
instance, had said that the landing did not succeed, and had been driven
off with immense slaughter? Apart from the fact that such a cable would
have made many poor women in <location country="England">England</location> unhappy for a few hours, the
fabrication would have done us positive good: when the truth was known
the relief would have been enormous, we would have gained handsome
recognition of what had actually been done, and German inspired lies
would have been discounted in future.</p>

<p>"But there is no _moral_ in the world that can stand against a carefully
engineered disappointment. When you know perfectly well that the spirits
of the people are bound to be dashed down to the depths within a few
days, it is unsound statesmanship surely so to engineer the Press that
you raise those selfsame spirits sky high in the meantime. To climb up
and up is a funny way to prepare for a fall! If you know that your
balloon must burst in five minutes you use that time in letting out gas,
not in throwing away ballast. If you want to spoil a man's legacy of
£500 tell him the previous evening he has been left £50,000!</p>

<p>"As I began by saying, do please forgive me, my dear <person name="Callwell">Callwell</person>, for
taking up your most precious time. But <person name="Callwell">you</person> are more in touch with this
particular business than anyone else at the War Office and, from <person name="Callwell">your</person> 
large mindedness, I feel sure you will be able to spare me some
sympathy, and perhaps even get some recognition for the general
principle I herewith put forward:--</p>



<p>"(1). Do not too curiously censor false alarmist reports put about by
the enemy. Let the papers publish them with a query and then smash them
as soon as this can be done with positive certainty.</p>

<p>"(2). Mercilessly censor any report which you think is, even in the
smallest degree, overstating your own case.</p>

<p>"The system needs courage but, with the <location country="England">British</location> Public, it would pay!</p>

<p>                           "Yours sincerely,
                              (_Sd._), "IAN HAMILTON."</p>

<p>As suspense had, by now, become unbearable, cabled home asking S. of S.
to "let me know, as soon as you can safely do so," when the new
divisions may be expected. I tell him I have "informal" news from the
French but dare not take action on that.</p>

<p>_14th September, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ Mails in with Ward as King's Messenger.
<person name="Vitali">Captain Vitali</person> (Italian liaison officer) and <person name="Cpt.Williams">Captain Williams</person> dined.
<person name="Vitali">Vitali</person> is worried about <person name="Vitali">his</person> status. <person name="Vitali">He</person> was told in the first instance <person name="Vitali">he</person>
was to be liaison officer between General <person name="Luigi_Cadorna">Cadorna</person> and myself. On this
understanding we agreed to <person name="Vitali">his</person> coming to our Headquarters. Once <person name="Vitali">he</person> was
here the Italian Government (not <person name="Luigi_Cadorna">Cadorna</person> <person name="Vitali">he</person> is careful to explain) said
<person name="Vitali">he</person> must be permanently attached to us. <person name="Vitali">Vitali</person> feels himself in a false
position as <person name="Vitali">he</person> thinks that,--had we known, we might not have let him
come. Personally, I am quite glad to have him; but we did not have much
talk as, immediately after dinner, <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person> brought me the decipher
of <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person>'s answer to my reminder to him. This has greatly saddened me
and takes up the whole of my thoughts.</p>

<p>"(No. 7843, cipher). From <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Earl Kitchener</person> to General Sir <person name="Ian_Hamilton">Ian Hamilton</person>.
Reference your No. M.F. 630. I have just returned from <location country="France">France</location> where I
went to settle up the questions asked in that telegram which were in a
very indefinite state owing apparently to a decision having been arrived
at by the French Government without reference to their military
advisers. The outcome of my meeting with <person name="Millerand">Millerand</person>, <person name="Joffre">Joffre</person> and <person name="Sarrail">Sarrail</person>
was that the French force of four Divisions proposed to be sent to the
<location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> cannot leave until the result of the approaching offensive
in <location country="France">France</location> is determined. If it be as successful as hoped for your
position in the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> would naturally be affected favourably. It
is hoped that the issue will be clear in the first few days of October,
and if indecisive, that by 10th October two of our Divisions may be at
Marseilles for embarkation to be followed closely by the four French
Divisions. The embarkation and transport of so large a force would, it
is thought, take about a month, but this has still to be worked out in
detail, so that by about the middle of November would be the time when
all would be ready.</p>

<p>"In the meantime, as transport is available, I shall continue to send
you reinforcements and drafts of which you are fully informed, up to
20th instant, and on which you should alone calculate.</p>

<p>"<person name="Sarrail">Sarrail</person>, backed by General <person name="Bailloud">Bailloud</person>, is greatly in favour of the French
expedition being employed independently on the Asiatic shore.</p>

<p>"<person name="Joffre">Joffre</person> greatly doubts the wisdom of this course, and <person name="Millerand">Millerand</person>
requested me to ask you to state fully and confidentially, for his
personal information, your opinion on this matter.</p>

<p>"<person name="Joffre">Joffre</person>'s objections appear to be that a landing in Asia opens up a very
wide field if the force be not immediately successful, and that in that
case more troops, munitions and drafts would be eventually required than
<person name="Joffre">he</person> could spare with due regard to the safety of <location country="France">France</location>.</p>

<p>"Secondly, <person name="Joffre">he</person> is not very confident of <person name="Sarrail">Sarrail</person>'s leadership,
particularly as the plans <person name="Sarrail">Sarrail</person> has made seem to be worthless. <person name="Joffre">Joffre</person>
is having careful plans worked out by <person name="Joffre">his</person> Staff for the expedition on
the Asiatic shore which, <person name="Joffre">he</person> says, though unfinished, do not look
promising. The same objection on <person name="Joffre">his</person> part would not, I gather, be felt
if the French troops were given a definite area and objective on the
<location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location> Peninsula, where the scope of their activities, and
consequently the support required from <location country="France">France</location>, could be limited."</p>

<p>Where's the use of M. <person name="Millerand">Millerand</person>'s consulting me over what lies on the
far side of a dead wall? Had <person name="Millerand">he</person> asked me to show why action here should
have priority over action in <location country="France">France</location>, then I might have been of some use.
But that is settled: the four French Divisions earmarked for the East
will not now be sent until _after_ "the results of the coming offensive
in <location country="France">France</location> have been determined." "If the success of this push equals
expectations you will reap the benefit." If indecisive then, "by the
10th October," two <location country="England">British</location> Divisions and four French Divisions will be
at Marseilles ready to sail out here: "about the middle of November
would be the time when everything would be ready." There are altogether
too many ifs and ands and pots and pans about <person name="Millerand">Millerand</person>'s question.
When a man starts going West who can foretell how long it will take him
to arrive at the East?</p>

<p>(1) If the push in the West is victorious we will score, says <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> That is
so. Far as the Western battlefield lies from the scene of our struggle,
the report of a German defeat in <location country="France">France</location> would reverberate Eastwards and
would lend us a brave moral impetus. But the point I would raise is
this:--did <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person>, as representing a huge Eastern Empire, press firmly upon
<person name="Millerand">Millerand</person> and <person name="Joffre">Joffre</person> the alternative,--_if the push in the East is
victorious the West will score_?</p>

<p>What express strategical gain do they expect from pushing back the
Germans? A blow which merely destroys a proportion of men and material
without paralysing the resources of the enemy is a blow in the air. War
cannot be waged by tactics alone. That is a barbaric method. To bend
back the German lines in the West, or to push the first line back on to
the second or third, or twentieth, has of itself but slight strategical
or economic import.</p>

<p>Here, on the other hand, we have literally in our grasp a clear cut gift
offered us by the Gods. The impossible part, the landing, is done. All
that remains is so many fresh men and so many thousand shell. The result
is not problematical, but mathematical. Napoleon is the only man who has
waged a world war in the world as we know it to-day. Napoleon said, I
think it was on the famous raft, "Who holds <location town="Constantinople">Constantinople</location> is master of
the world." And there it lies at the mercy of the Briton--could he only
convince <person name="Joffre">Joffre</person> that the shortest cut to freeing <person name="Joffre">his</person> country from the
Germans lies through the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location>.</p>

<p>The principles which should underlie Entente strategy will be clear to
military historians although obscured to-day by jealousies and
amateurishness: just the usual one, two, three they are, in this
order:--</p>



<p>(a) Hold the sea.</p>

<p>(b) Hold the West.</p>

<p>(c) Smash the Turk.</p>

<p>A couple of miles won by us here gives <location country="England">England</location> wheat and <location country="Russia">Russia</location> rifles;
gives us the whip hand in the Balkans plus security in a couple of
Continents. A couple of miles lost by us here leaves the German with a
strengthened grip upon all the real world objectives for which he went
to war: it leaves us with a ruined prestige in Asia. But what is all
that to <person name="Joffre">Joffre</person> to whom, as a good Frenchman, the Balkans; the bracing up
of the Russian Army; all the Odessa corn; Asia and Africa thrown in, do
not count against _one departement_ of _la Patrie_.</p>

<p>(2) If the push in the West is indecisive then our push is only to be
postponed. Postponed! The word is like a knell. To write it gives me a
feeling of sick despair. Only postponed! As well cable at once, _only_
ruined!!</p>

<p>(3) But there is a third eventuality not mentioned by <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> How if our
attack upon the main strength of the entrenched Germans is beaten off?
To <person name="Joffre">Joffre</person> <location country="France">France</location> comes first and the rest nowhere--every time: that
is natural. But our Higher Direction are not Frenchmen--not yet!
Armageddon is actually being fought _here_, at the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location>, and the
<location country="England">British</location> outlook is focused on <location country="France">France</location>. We are to sit here and rot away
with cholera, and see the winter gales approach, until the big push has
been made in the West where men can afford to wait--where they are
healthy--where time is all on their side. And this push in the West is
against the whole <location country="Germany">German Empire</location> linked to all its own vast resources by
a few miles of the best railways in the world. We _can_ attack here with
more men and more munitions than the enemy the very moment we care to
accept the principle that, _at this moment_, <location town="Constantinople">Constantinople</location> and the
heartening up of <location country="Russia">Russia</location> and ascendency amongst the Balkan States are not
only the true positive objectives of our strategy, but are the sole
strategical stunts upon the board. We can do so because of our sea
power. We can borrow enough howitzers, aeroplanes, munitions and drafts
from the West; apply them here and then, if necessary, return them. We
are not exploiting our own special characteristics, mobility and sea
power!</p>

<p>[Illustration: MARSHALL LIMAN VON SANDERS _"Exclusive News" phot._]</p>

<p>Easy to preach patience to a nation in agony? Yes, for the whole agony
of the whole world is more important even than the agonies of <location country="France">France</location>.
We've got to win the war and win it quick. There's only one way to do
that. The resources of the Entente are not equal to carrying on two
offensives at the same moment. If our Army in the West will just sit
tight awhile, we here will beat the Turks, and snip the last economic
lien binding the Central Powers to the outside world.</p>

<p>Once more, our game is to _defend_ in the West until the _attack_ in the
East has borne economic fruit in the shape of ships and corn: political
fruit in the sentiment of the Balkans: military fruit in the fillip
given to the whole force of the Entente by actual tactical contact
between the <location country="England">British</location> soldiers and the rank and file of the Ruskies. The
collapse of the Central Powers,--eclipsed in full view of all Asia and
Africa by the smoke from the funnels of the <location country="England">British</location> Fleet at anchor in
the Golden Horn is what we are after here. Even if French and <person name="Joffre">Joffre</person> do
drive the German main hordes back to the Rhine the scope of their scoop
would be far less than ours, for we by getting to <location town="Constantinople">Constantinople</location> can
starve those main armies stiff.</p>

<p>How few of our people know anything of the Russians. At least, I have
been attached for eight months to the Armies which fought against them
in the field; have visited <location country="Russia">Russia</location> and Siberia and have done two peace
manoeuvres as their guest. To send superior officers to <location country="Russia">Russia</location> only
produces jealousy; to send supplies only breeds dishonesty. But with
50,000 <location country="England">British</location> soldiers as yeast we could leaven 5,000,000 Muscovites;
we could fire their inert masses with our ardour; this is the best of
all uses to which 50,000 <location country="England">British</location> soldiers could at present be put.</p>

<p>From the early days when <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> told me the New Army should go to <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location>,
<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> had an intuition at the back of <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person> big mind that victory would dawn
in the East. But <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> is no longer the <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> of <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person>, the old <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> of Khartoum
 and Pretoria. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">He</person> still has <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person> moments of God-sent intuition. First, <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person>
had _absolute_ knowledge that the Germans would come through Belgium: I
repeat this. The assumption was not uncommon perhaps, but he _knew the
fact_! Secondly, when everyone else spoke of a six weeks' war; when
every other soldier I can think of except <person name="Douglas_Haig">Douglas Haig</person> believed he'd be
back before the grouse shooting was over; <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> went nap on a three years'
war. Pray heaven <person name="Douglas_Haig">he</person> was wrong; but, right or wrong, <person name="Douglas_Haig">he</person> has already
proved himself to have been nearer the mark than anyone else. Thirdly,
he had a call (by heavenly telepathy, I suppose) that his New Armies
must go out to the East. There is no more question about this than there
is about Belgium and the three years' duration. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">He</person> has told me so; time
and again.</p>

<p>Why then does <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> not act accordingly if <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person>'s in the Almighty know?
Because <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> can't. With the one exception of the Battle of <location town="Paardeberg">Paardeberg</location>, <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person>
never in <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person> palmiest days pretended to be a man of action. But now <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person>
has lost <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person> faculty of forcing others to act. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">He</person> makes a spurt but <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person>
can't stay the distance. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">He</person> has met <person name="Millerand">Millerand</person>, French and <person name="Joffre">Joffre</person> in
Council and allowed the searchlights of <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person> genius to be snuffed out!
That is what surprises me:--<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">He</person>, who once could deflect <person name="Joe_Chamberlain">Joe Chamberlain</person>
and <person name="Milner">Milner</person> from their orbits; who twisted stiff-necked Boers round his
little finger; who bore down <person name="Mr.Asquith">Asquith</person>, <person name="Winston">Winston</person>, <person name="Prince_Louis">Prince Louis</person> and <person name="Beatty">Beatty</person>
in Valetta Harbour--East _versus_ West--Mediterranean _versus_ N/orth
Sea--who, from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m., withstood, wrestled with and overthrew
Haldane's arguments in favour of his taking up the succession to the
<person name="Duke_of_Connaught">Duke of Connaught,</person> and that although <person name="Duke_of_Connaught">he</person> had one arm tied to <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person> side by
having taken the King's shilling. What a marvel <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> was and now--</p>

<p>  Ichabod!</p>

<p>There is something so tragical in what home letters let us guess that
the pity of it almost makes me forget our own stillborn projects.</p>

<p>_15th September, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ <person name="Altham">Altham</person> and Major Hood left G.H.Q. for L.
of C. Headquarters. Had another hour with <person name="Altham">Altham</person> before <person name="Altham">he</person> got aboard
<person name="Altham">his</person> destroyer. Gave an interview to <person name="Buchanan">Buchanan</person>, A.M.S. After lunch,
<person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person>, <person name="Val">Val</person>, <person name="Wells">Wells</person>, <person name="Deedes">Deedes</person>, <person name="Freddie">Freddie</person> and <person name="Ian_Hamilton">myself</person> went off to <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location>
aboard <location ship="H.M.S. Scourge">H.M.S. _Scourge_</location> (Lieutenant-Commander Tupper). On landing,
<person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person> branched off to see the G.S. <person name="Gen.Byng">Byng</person> has a keen sense of
humour; is energetic and by <person name="Gen.Byng">his</person> looks and manner attracts all ranks. No
one could wish a better corps commander and I have never in all my
experience known anyone take greater and more minute trouble with <person name="Gen.Byng">his</person>
field days and manoeuvres than <person name="Gen.Byng">he</person> did in <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> the year before the
war. But <person name="Gen.Byng">his</person> sojourn on the Western front has given him inflated
standards as to the number of guns and stocks of H.E. shell which are
essential to success; especially with troops who have suffered heavy
losses. Perhaps <person name="Gen.Byng">he</person> is right. This para. from a letter written to the
great man to-night explains more generally what I feel:--</p>



<p>"<person name="Maude">Maude</person> is burning to get on and do something and I heard him myself ask
<person name="Gen.Byng">Byng</person> when <person name="Maude">he</person> was going to let him have a dash. As to <person name="Gen.Byng">Byng</person>, I think
myself <person name="Gen.Byng">he</person> is not quite sure yet about the spirit of <person name="Gen.Byng">his</person> men. I have been
trying to spur <person name="Gen.Byng">him</person> on for the last day or so, although only by very
gentle hints, as I think, with a man of <person name="Gen.Byng">Byng</person>'s great reputation, one
must leave <person name="Gen.Byng">him</person> to <person name="Gen.Byng">himself</person> for as long as possible. I daresay <person name="Gen.Byng">he</person> may be
quite right and very wise. Still, these reinforcements have brought the
<location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay troops up to no less than 37,000 men, and I am most anxious
they should do something soon a little more rapid than sapping out
slowly towards the enemy's lines--which they are doing."</p>

<p>After my talk with <person name="Gen.Byng">Byng</person>, we went on to meet <person name="Fanshawe">Fanshawe</person> and <person name="de_Lisle">de Lisle</person>. <person name="Maude">Maude</person>
came along with me as far as the crestline. I asked <person name="Maude">him</person> about <person name="Maude">his</person>
Division. <person name="Maude">He</person> replied: "Sir <person name="Ian_Hamilton">Ian</person>, may <person name="Maude">I</person> be frank with you about the
Division?" At these ominous words I shivered. They positively gave me
he shivers. So I braced myself up when I answered, "But of course!"
<person name="Maude">Maude</person> then said, "If you give the order now, and will arrange for a
little artillery support, <person name="Maude">my</person> Division will storm and hold on to any
thousand yards of <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> trench you like to point out; to-morrow." I
could have embraced him, but I had to go steady and explain to <person name="Maude">him</person> that
a Corps Commander must judge all his Divisions and that, taking the
situation as a whole, <person name="Gen.Byng">Byng</person> did not think it fair on the men to let them
have a dart yet--not, at least, till they had more munitions at their
back. <person name="Gen.Byng">Byng</person> has had wide experiences in the West and <person name="Gen.Byng">he</person> looks on it as
trying the men unfairly to ask them to attack without a preliminary
bombardment on a scale which we cannot at present afford. "Yes," said
<person name="Maude">Maude</person>, "that is all very well but after all you must remember the Turks
have neither the artillery nor the munitions the Germans have at their
command on the Western front."</p>

<p>"Well," I replied, "you put your points to <person name="Gen.Byng">Byng</person> and you know I am a man
who never yet in my life refused a good brave offer like yours." <person name="Maude">He</person> has
a great admiration for <person name="Gen.Byng">Byng</person> and so, though sadly, <person name="Maude">he</person> went away.</p>

<p><person name="Fanshawe">Fanshawe</person> met me at the South end of the Division trenches, as bright and
keen as a new nail. His men, too, seem full of go. <person name="Fanshawe">Fanshawe</person> hopes to
carry the whole ridge whenever <person name="Fanshawe">he</person> gets the order. The <unit type="division">11th Division</unit>
promise to be as fine a unit as any in the Army once they get their gaps
filled in.</p>

<p>_16th September, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ We had quite a lively morning here. At
7.30 an enemy's biplane dropped four bombs on our Headquarters camp and
got away with hardly a shot fired at it. At 7.50 an enemy's Taube came
over and dropped bombs near my Signal Tent, also a little summer shower
of small steel darts: five men were wounded. At 8.10 a.m. yet another
enemy biplane circled round but was kept at a respectful distance by the
ship's guns.</p>

<p>Gave an interview to <person name="Stewart">Colonel Stewart</person>, Armoured Car Squadron.</p>

<p><person name="Foumet">Vice-Admiral Foumet</person> and Staff called on me in the forenoon. <person name="Foumet">He</person> replaces
<person name="Nicol">Admiral Nicol</person> gone sick. Mails went out this evening. <person name="Freddie">Freddie</person> and I
gave tone to our debilitated constitutions by dining with the ever
hospitable V.A. on the _<location ship="H.M.S. Triad">Triad</location>_.</p>

<p>A cable from <person name="Dawnay">Dawnay</person> saying <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> "would not regard unfavourably" a
withdrawal from <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay.</p>

<p><person name="Dawnay">Dawnay</person> left under the cloud of the 21st August. <person name="Dawnay">He</person> it was who
rough-drafted the cable (in very much stronger terms than my final
version) suggesting that we might have to draw in our horns if we were
not kept up to strength. Since then our skies have cleared; the spirit
of the men has risen to set fair and we have got drafts enough, not for
a big push but certainly to enable us to be delighted should the Turks
attempt any sort of an attack, either at <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> or anywhere else. The
Turks, in fact, are strictly on the defensive both actually and in their
spirit.</p>

<p>_17th September, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ Had been going to <location bay="Anzac">Anzac</location> to inspect and
then to bring <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdie</person> back to stay with me. But the weather was too bad.
<person name="Cpt.Birdwood">He</person> got here all right as the wind is from the North and he was able to
climb aboard under the lee of Nibrunesi Point. Just as well, perhaps, we
did not go, for one way or another a good deal of extra work had to be
got through. One thing; two cables from <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person> to the War Office have
been repeated to us here; inadvertently we think; divertingly for sure.
The story is this:--</p>



<p>A few days ago we were offered the <unit type="brigade">51st</unit> and <unit type="brigade">53rd Sikhs</unit> who, despite
their titles, are half Mahomedan. After consulting <person name="Cox">Cox</person>, <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdie</person> and
other <location country="India">Indian</location> Army Officers I cabled back saying we would gladly have
them "as soon as transport can be arranged," unless French is willing to
exchange them for two purely non-Mahomedan units. Here are the
collateral cables from <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person> to the War Office:--</p>



<p>"Both the <unit type="brigade">51st</unit> and <unit type="brigade">53rd Sikhs</unit> have already been disembarked. They had
better remain off ship as long as possible, I think, since they are
reported to be feverish. The troopship can wait at Port Said. The men on
the canal, I should like to point out, barely get two nights in bed per
week."</p>

<p>"I have been asked by Hamilton to send him a double Company of Patiala
Sikhs to reinforce the <unit type="brigade">14th Sikhs.</unit> I can do this, and if you concur I
think it is a better arrangement than to send him the <unit type="brigade">51st</unit> and <unit type="brigade">53rd</unit>
Sikhs."</p>

<p>The Sikhs meant for <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location> are gone; we shall never see them more;
they mount guard by night against the ghosts of the Suez Canal.</p>

<p>Another thing; a Correspondent writes in and tells us that for the
honour of his profession he feels bound to let us know that <person name="Ashmead_Bartlett">Mr.
Ashmead-Bartlett</person> has secretly sent home an uncensored despatch _per_, of
all people in the world, Mr.<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person>!</p>

<p>I had begun to wonder what had come over Mr.<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person> and now it seems <person name="Ian_Hamilton">he</person>
has come over me!</p>

<p>The next paper on the table was my draft cable of advice for M.
<person name="Millerand">Millerand</person>. <person name="Joffre">Joffre</person> wants <person name="Joffre">his</person> four Divisions to land on the Peninsula;
<person name="Sarrail">Sarrail</person> wishes them to work along the Asiatic side. No doubt the views
of the French Generals are being coloured by their wish to stand as
clear as they can of <location country="England">British</location> command. So I have been careful to sweep
away _that_ obstacle by offering to stand down. Now they can fix up the
problem on its merits:--</p>



<p>"Closest consideration has been given to your No. 7843, cipher. Until
now I have consistently opposed a landing on the Asiatic side of the
<location straits="Dardanelles">Straits</location> with less than 6 divisions--see my telegram No. M.F. 349 of 19th
June. On <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location> Peninsula area and difficulties of supply limited
liabilities of the opposing forces whereas mainland of Asia gave scope
for the deployment of large forces by the enemy. Now, however, the
situation is clearing up and there has been a great change in the
conditions.</p>

<p>"The Turks had formerly 10,000 to 12,000 men on Asiatic shore with large
reserves on the Peninsula available to cross over there if necessary.
Now Anatolia and Syria have been drained of troops to oppose us on the
Peninsula where the Turks have far longer front to hold, namely, 9-1/2
miles instead of 2-1/2, whilst our position and strength at <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> and
Anzac are more threatening to their communications than was our position
at Anzac in June. If, therefore, we can be strong enough to maintain
pressure on whole <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> line on the Peninsula it is unlikely that
Turks could detach troops to oppose French landing on Asiatic shore.
Assuming even that the Turks were enabled to release every soldier from
Thrace by a definite understanding being arrived at with <location country="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</location>, I
calculate they might gather a total of five divisions but of these
probably only one or at most two would be on Asiatic side at beginning
of the operations and would probably be scattered so that opposition in
strength to surprise landing is improbable. Moreover, only one of the
divisions is composed of good Nizam troops, others believed to be not up
to establishment. The Asiatic coast down to Yukeri Bay is now heavily
trenched but I do not think much has been done below that point.
Supposing, therefore, French bring good divisions at war strength and
succeed in keeping their destination secret, they appear to have a good
chance of obtaining good covering positions without much loss and of
thence advancing on Chanak defeating any <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> forces sent against
them. Degree of their success would depend on whether the entrenched
positions which have been prepared on the Kum Kale--Ehren Keui road
could be turned by the good road which leads from <location town="Yukeri">Yukeri</location> through <location town="Ezine">Ezine</location>
and <location town="Ishiklar">Ishiklar</location> to <location town="Chanak">Chanak</location>, as it is unlikely that Turks would be able to
quickly organize new defensive positions with entirely new line of
supply. The distance of landing place from objective is a secondary
consideration. It is easier to march and fight 100 miles than to take
three lines of trenches. In the one case there is room for manoeuvre
at which Turks are bad while in the other case siege warfare results at
which the Turks stand supreme. Once Ehren Keui reached, the Turks
between that place and Kum Kale would be forced to retire and Kum Kale
would become our base, thereby greatly shortening line of supply.
Supposing Turks endeavoured to make bridgehead on <location town="Chanak">Chanak</location> promontory, the
country is so big that large forces would be necessary and once the
Turks were cut off from North their supply difficulties would be most
serious. French possession of Chanak should be equivalent to victory,
but as Turks are stubborn fellows it is better to confine anticipations
to commencement of results which I consider would be as
follows:--Cutting off of <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> supply line Chanak to Akbashi Liman.
Narrows would be useless to Turks. Nagara communications could be cut.
Our 15-inch howitzer could be used to batter Kilid Bahr forts. Allied
Fleets should be able to enter <location straits="Marmara">Marmora</location> without loss.</p>

<p>"Turning to alternatives. If French were held up and unable to reach
<location town="Chanak">Chanak</location>, at least the last <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> reserves would have been used up and I
think happy termination of operations though postponed would begin to
come clearly into view. Supposing the worst happened and that the French
were compelled to fall back after landing. In that case a clear road for
retirement to a bridgehead would be open. Positions covering landing
could be taken up and there they would continue to draw towards them
considerable <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> forces which would otherwise be available for use
on <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Peninsula.</location></p>

<p>"Finally, greater difficulties beset all other schemes. The notorious
military disadvantages of independent command would be less harmful if
the respective armies were separated by the Straits than if they were
mixed up together on Peninsula. As <location heights="Achi Baba">Achi Baba</location> is now one of the
strongest fortresses in Europe, it would be unpopular to palm off the
Cape <location country="Greece">Helles</location> end upon the French. Moreover, all the French here are, and
always have been, dead set on Asia. If the French were employed at <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location>
they would have to fight side by side with the <location country="England">British</location>, a situation
which, with co-equal commanders, would be a military absurdity. Were
that course decided upon, I would ask the Allied Governments to make up
their minds which General had the most daring, brains and experience,
and if it were the Frenchman I would serve under him loyally.</p>

<p>"As to making the attempt to the North of the Gulf of Xeros: a landing
there is certain to be opposed, and the <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> reinforcements which are
always held ready in the neighbourhood of <location town="Uzunkipru">Uzunkiupru</location> and <location town="Keshan">Keshan</location> could
arrive in strength very quickly and imperil the whole project. A further
objection lies in the distance of the French intermediate base and great
strain it would throw on Allied Fleets. Finally, it is all-important
that absolute secrecy should be maintained. I suggest that it should be
allowed to leak out that the destination of the French is Enos, this
would probably have the effect of tricking <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> troops in Thrace, as
Enos is a destination which would gain most credence."</p>

<p><person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdie</person> has at last worn off the fine edge of <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">his</person> keenness; <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">he</person> looks a
little tired: General <person name="Russell">Russell</person>, the New Zealander, dined also and was in
great form.</p>

<p>Left G.H.Q. at noon to-day, 18th, sailed to <location country="Greece">Helles</location>; lunched with Davies;
went up to inspect the East Lanes Division. The trenches are in
apple-pie order and the men are in good heart, but the stomach has
always been held to be the mainstay of the fighting man, and theirs are
in the grip of enteritis. Stopped at 5th Corps Headquarters on my way
back.</p>

<p><person name="de_Putron">De Putron</person> and <person name="la_Borde">la Borde</person> came back with me. Struck an interesting
scientist called <person name="Lawes">Lawes</person> whilst I was in the Lancashire trenches. As we
were entering the harbour at Kephalos an enemy Taube tried to drop a
bomb aboard. No harm.</p>

<p>Dined with the V.A. together with <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdie</person>, Lord <person name="Anglesey">Anglesey</person> and <person name="Freddie">Freddie</person>.</p>

<p>When we got back found this from War Office. Rather amusing to be in the
know of the counter moves and to see their outcome:--</p>



<p>"The exchange of battalions mentioned in No. 7873, cipher, of 14th
September cannot be effected, so that at present the <unit type="brigade">51st</unit> and <unit type="brigade">53rd</unit> Sikhs
will not proceed to <location country="France">France</location>. From the <person name="Commanding">General Officer Commanding</person>,
<location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>'s, telegram No. 1854. E. of 15th September, it is understood that
<person name="Commanding">he</person> can send you another double company of Patiala Sikhs to reinforce the
<unit type="brigade">14th Sikhs.</unit> Possibly this will suffice for your requirements in the
meantime, and the <unit type="brigade">51st</unit> and <unit type="brigade">53rd</unit> Sikhs will be left at the disposal of
<person name="Commanding">General Officer Commanding</person>, <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>. If so, will you please make
arrangements with him accordingly?</p>

<p>"Repeated to <person name="Commanding">General Officer Commanding</person>, <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>."</p>

<p>Our defeat is a foregone conclusion: the Senoussi is too strong for us.
All the same I am determined to press the matter to an issue, if only to
have a clean cut precedent as to whether we do have a first call on
troops in <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> or whether it is the other way about. We want these men
so badly. They don't get sick here; are worth four European Battalions
at present, and <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdie</person> has become most anxious to get them, especially
the 53rd. So I am cabling to <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person> just to send us our troops (for
they are ours) forthwith and have cabled to the War Office:--</p>



<p>"With reference to your telegram No. 8012, cipher. In accordance with
your telegram No. 8711, of 11th September, I am asking General Officer
Commanding, <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>, to send here, at once, the <unit type="brigade">51st</unit> and <unit type="brigade">53rd Sikhs</unit>, as I
cannot do without them. I shall be very glad to receive the Patiala
Sikhs as well, as the 14th Sikhs are badly in need of a reinforcement."</p>

<p>Imagine had we been sent <location country="India">Indian</location> Divisions for <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> and if the New Army,
Territorials and Yeomen had been sent instead to <location country="France">France</location>! Each category
would have given (let me put it mildly) double value. The heat, the
thirst, the scrub, the snipers, all so disconcerting to our fresh
contingents would have been commonplaces of frontier warfare to our
<location country="India">Indian</location> troops. See what the handful with us here have achieved. Yet in
vain do I write and cable my personal entreaties to <person name="Beauchamp_Duff">Beauchamp Duff</person>, the
all-powerful Commander-in-Chief in <location country="India">India</location>, and a very old friend, for two
hundred Sikhs: first <person name="Beauchamp_Duff">he</person> offers me a couple of hundred Brahmins wherewith
to fill the ranks of the famous <unit type="brigade">14th Sikhs</unit> and then, when I hesitate
before a proposal which appears monstrous, withdraws even that offer.
Again, I beg for 200 recruits for the <unit type="brigade">14th</unit>, saying I will train them
myself; I am refused--very politely and at great length--refused,
because it would be "politically inexpedient" to send them. In vain do
we try to get our own two battalions through the <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>ian morass; they
are going to stick and do sentry go over nothing. Why; were there any
real trouble in <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> I could land a whole Division there within four
and a half days!</p>

<p>As for the New Army and Territorials, gradually entered with their
veteran comrades in the trenches of <location country="France">France</location> and <location town="Flanders">Flanders</location>, they too would
have had more familiar surroundings and fairer play--as everyone here
now recognizes, too late!</p>

<p>The crystals of history take shape while we fight. As in a glass darkly
the outlines begin to appear to anyone who has a moment wherein to peer
beyond the end of the war. Everything has gone by the contrary. Our
people have done as well as their neighbours, and better, with their
imaginations, whether in diplomacy, strategy or tactics. Where the
Gibbon or Plutarch who survives the War Office Censor is going to damn
their reputations into heaps is over their failure in business
commonsense. Under their noses, parts of their system, were two great
live organisms; the <location country="India">Indian</location> Army and the Territorial Force. From the
moment the mobilization flag was dropped it was up to them to work tooth
and nail to treble or quadruple these sound, vigorous existing entities.
What have they done? After a year of war, the <location country="India">Indian</location> Army and the
Territorial Army are staggering on their last legs instead of being the
best part of our forces. Compare the <unit type="division">East Lanes Division</unit>, who had the
good fortune to escape from War Office clutches by getting right out to
<location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> at the outbreak of the war, with Territorial Divisions which have
remained since then under the eyes and in the hands of the War Office!</p>

<p>The Turks are still withdrawing troops from the Caucasus front to ours.
Good for the Russians. Whilst I was at <location country="Greece">Helles</location>, the enemy guns started a
heavy bombardment along the whole of our nine mile front from the right
of <location bay="Anzac">Anzac</location> to the left of <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location>; a heavy musketry fire also along the
<location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> trenches. An attempt was then made to launch infantry assaults
against our lines, but these fizzled out, the rank and file having no
heart for the job. There is no doubt the Turks have had enough of it.
They can still hold on, but that's about all.</p>

<entry>
<p>_21st September, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ Further development of the Sikh
comedy:--<person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person> cables, "No. 1883 E. Your No. M.F. 648. <person name="Maxwell">I</person> have received
no orders to send these regiments. According to <person name="Maxwell">my</person> last information from
the War Office they were to remain here, as <person name="Maxwell">I</person> require them, but that <person name="Maxwell">I</person>
should send you a double company of Patiala Sikhs to reinforce the <unit type="battalion">14th
Sikhs.</unit>"</p>

<p>I have cabled this on to the War Office, saying, "As I understand it,
your No. 8012 of 18th September does not mean that the War Office have
withdrawn the offer of these two regiments, which are urgently required
here. I therefore hope that you will give early authority to General
Officer Commanding, <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>, to send them on to Mediterranean
Expeditionary Force."</p>

<p>The battalions were thrown at my head when that grand statement was made
as to the grand army I commanded; now where are they?</p>

<p>Started off with <person name="Taylor">Taylor</person>, <person name="Freddie">Freddie</person> and Colonel <person name="Napier">Napier</person> (<location country="England">British</location> Military
Attaché to <location country="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</location>) for <location bay="Anzac">Anzac</location>. No shelling. Went round the whole left
centre and left of <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdie</person>'s position to right and left of Cheshire
Point, and saw the new <location country="Australia">Australia</location> Division--very fine fellows. Bullets
were on the whistle and "the boys" were as keen and happy as any real
schoolboys. Memories of the Khyber, Chitral and Tirah can hardly yield
samples of a country so tangled and broken. Where the Turks begin and
where we end is a puzzler, and if you do happen to take a wrong turning
it leads to Paradise. Met various <location country="Australia">Australia</location> friends--a full-blown Lord
Mayor--many other leading citizens both of <location town="Melbourne">Melbourne</location> and of <location town="Sydney">Sydney</location>.</p>

<p>At 5 p.m. re-embarked. <person name="Napier">Napier</person> gave birth to a happy thought on our way
back. His idea is that we should transfer the troops on the <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location>
Peninsula to <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> so as to hearten up the Serbians and Greeks and
dishearten our enemies at <location town="Sofia">Sofia</location>. <person name="Napier">He</person> has pressed <person name="Napier">his</person> view, <person name="Napier">he</person> said, on
the Foreign Office. I asked him if <person name="Napier">his</person> Chief, the Minister at <location town="Sofia">Sofia</location>,
stood behind him. <person name="Napier">He</person> said <person name="Napier">he</person> could not vouch for <person name="Napier">his</person> Minister's views,
but that <person name="Napier">he</person>, <person name="Napier">Napier</person>, had power in <person name="Napier">his</person> capacity as Military Attaché to
correspond with the <location country="England">British</location> Government direct.</p>

<p><person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> himself did at one time toy with the thought of sending <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person> New Army
to <location country="Serbia">Serbia</location> either under <person name="Rundle">Rundle</person> or <person name="Ian_Hamilton">myself</person>, and was only restrained by the
outbreak of typhus in that country. But, keen as I was for the warpath,
a very little study of the terrain and supply question was enough to
cool my ardour.</p>

<p><location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> is ruled out by history. In all the campaigns waged of old in
these very regions the part played by <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> has been naval, not
military. There must have been some reason for this: there was; it still
exists--geography! You could not, and cannot, carry out anything big
_via_ a couple of narrow cracks through a trackless labyrinth of
mountains. The problem is a repetition of the <location country="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</location> dilemma. A big
army would starve at <location town="Nisch">Nisch</location> and along the Danube; a small army would be
swallowed up by the enemy. Unless they are going to trust to <location country="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</location>
and <location country="Romania">Roumania</location> for supplies, one <location country="England">British</location> Army Corps is about as much as
can manage to live and fight in <location country="Serbia">Serbia</location>. If they want to make <location country="Serbia">Serbia</location> safe
their only possible chance is to push through to <location town="Constantinople">Constantinople</location>! There
is no other way. I said all this to <person name="Napier">Napier</person> and a lot more besides and
left him keener on <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> than ever.</p>

<p><person name="Napier">He</person> actually thinks that from <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> we could do what could be done by
us at any time at the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location>! <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> is no alternative to the
<location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location>. I wish the War Office could hear <person name="Gouraud">Gouraud</person>; <person name="Gouraud">Gouraud</person>, that big
sane man with local knowledge. How strong <person name="Gouraud">he</person> used to be on the point
that <location country="Greece">Greece</location> lay altogether outside the sphere of any military action by
the Entente. We can't feed <location country="Russia">Russia</location> with munitions through <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location>, nor
can we bring back Russian wheat _via_ <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location>,--not much, seeing we
would not be able to feed ourselves were we fifty miles into the
mountains. <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> is a military mare's nest.</p>

<p>Three cables:--</p>

being handed over to Chief Ordnance Officer, <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>. The former

<p>_22nd September, 1915._ <person name="Scatters_Wilson">Scatters</person> and <person name="Cheape">Cheape</person> sailed back for <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> at
6.45 a.m.--just in good time to avoid a raid on our Headquarters carried
out by three Taubes between 7.50 and 8 a.m. A dozen bombs dropped; no
serious harm done.</p>

<p><person name="Heseltine">Heseltine</person>, King's Messenger, came to dinner.</p>

<p>Bad news from <location country="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</location>. She is mobilizing, not, we may be sure, for the
sake of helping those who do not help themselves. Well do I remember
<person name="Ferdinand">Ferdinand</person>, as long ago as 1909, turning to me and saying as <person name="Ferdinand"> he</person> pointed
to a picture of himself in the robes of a Byzantine Emperor, "_Quand
vous arrivez au Bosphore, pensez à moi_." Well, there is one good side
to working over a narrow <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Peninsula</location>, under the guns of your own Fleet,
all the Bulgars in the Balkans cannot add a rifle to the number of enemy
troops on <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location>, who already, can only be munitioned, watered and
fed with the greatest difficulty. The more targets the enemy cram on to
their present narrow front the merrier for our gunners; the better the
chance for our submarines starving the lot of them. So long as our Fleet
holds the Ægean, we may snap our fingers at the Bulgarians, whereas
they, were they fools enough to come here, would live on tenter hooks
lest haply some fine morning our Fleet should sail into the Marmora.</p>

<p>Yes, two or three battleships in the Marmora! Think of it! The sea
communications, <location town="Constantinople">Constantinople</location>-<location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location> and Asia-<location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location>, would
cease, _ipso facto_, to exist. The railways between Europe and
<location town="Constantinople">Constantinople</location> and Asia and <location town="Constantinople">Constantinople</location> must shut down. In a
fortnight the Turks on the <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Peninsula</location> begin to pack up; in a month the
Turks in <location town="Constantinople">Constantinople</location> move bag and baggage from Europe to Asia. 
<person name="Ferdinand">Ferdinand</person> watching the cat's jump, prepares to turn those 400,000
bayonets of <person name="Ferdinand">his</person> against the <person name="Kaiser_Wilhelm_II">Kaiser</person>. So wags my world in the might-be;
very much "might-be" for the Navy are turning down the "to be" for the
third time of asking. Three times the Sibyl makes her prodigious offer:
May--August--September a new world for old battleships:--two--four--six!</p>

<p>_23rd September, 1915._ Stormy weather: the <location ship="H.M.S. Imogene">_Imogene_</location> could hardly crawl
out. Have written <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> to tell him how day succeeds day, never without
incident, but never with achievement; how we are burnt up with longing
to get on and how we know that he is as anxious. Yet, as I tell him,
_we_ "can't force the pace." How can we? We have not the
wherewithal--the stuff. "<person name="Gen.Byng">Byng</person> would like to have four days' successive
bombardment for an hour, and then attack, and speaks of one H.E. shell
per yard as pat as if they were shells we could pick up on the seashore.
I have assured <person name="Gen.Byng">him</person> it is no earthly use; that <person name="Gen.Byng">he</person> shall have <person name="Gen.Byng">his</person> share of
what I have got, but that stuff for bombardment is simply not in
existence,--not here, at least."</p>

<p>_24th September, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ Fought against exasperation all day. As
I thought:--</p>



<p>"(No. 8193, cipher). From <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Earl Kitchener</person> to General Sir <person name="Ian_Hamilton">Ian Hamilton</person>. In
the existing situation, the two battalions referred to in your No. M.F.
655 of 21st September, should remain for the present in <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>. I have
informed <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person> to this effect."</p>

<p><person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> has re-opened the idea of giving up <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location>, saying, "it might become
necessary in certain eventualities to abandon that area." In my reply I
have said, "I hope there will be no question now of the abandonment of
<location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location>.... In the Northern zone I have now more troops than at the time
of my telegram, my line is stronger, the old troops are resting, the new
troops are improving, and preparations are being made for a local
advance. At this stage withdrawal will be a great moral victory for the
Turks. Moreover, it would release a large number of enemy divisions to
oppose the Russians in Asia, or for other enterprises."</p>

<p>Another cable also sent dealing with the ever present, ever pressing,
ever ghastlier shortage upon the Peninsula generally:--</p>



<p>"My present shortages, 21st September, of infantry rank and file are
2,645 in the <unit type="division">XXIXth Division</unit>, 17,166 in the three New Army Divisions,
and 23,986 in the four Territorial Divisions, totalling 43,797; out of
respective establishments of 11,652, 37,869 and 44,824, total, 97,345."</p>

<p>Were the Royal Naval Division included the percentage would be worse.</p>

 <p><person name="Peter_Pollen">Peter Pollen</person> and I dined with the Admiral. After dinner, we discussed
<person name="Ferdinand">Fox-Ferdinand's</person> little tricks. The Admiral had heard a lot about <person name="Ferdinand">his</person>
flirtations with the <person name="Duke_of_Mecklenburg">Duke of Mecklenburg</person> lately sent from <location town="Berlin">Berlin</location> on some
sort of an ambassadorial mission to the Balkans. I told him of my visit
to <location town="Sofia">Sofia</location> during the interval which took place between <person name="Ferdinand">Prince Ferdinand</person>
proclaiming himself Tsar, and the tardy and unenthusiastic recognition
of <person name="Ferdinand">his</person> new rank by <location country="England">Great Britain.</location> <person name="Ferdinand">Ferdinand's</person> Court Chamberlain asked me
to dine. I wanted to refuse as I had meant to go on to <location town="Constantinople">Constantinople</location>,
but Sir George <person name="Buchanan">Buchanan</person>, our Minister, begged me to accept. Diplomatic
relations were broken off; <person name="Buchanan">he</person> had not seen <person name="Ferdinand">Ferdinand</person> for a month: <person name="Buchanan">he</person>
 wanted to know what that <person name="Ferdinand">Prince</person> would say to me: "_but_," <person name="Buchanan">he</person> added, "you
must on no account go in uniform. Seeing you are on the Army Council it
would almost amount to a recognition of <person name="Ferdinand">his</person> Kingship if you went there
in uniform." I thought this a little far-fetched; however, I wrote back
and said that I had the honour to accept, but that, as I was travelling,
I had only my _kleine Uniform_; i.e., undress kit, handy. I proposed,
therefore, with permission to take the liberty of presenting myself in
evening dress, wearing miniature medals and decorations and the ribbon
of the Grand Cross of the Bath. By return messenger an answer came back,
"<person name="Ferdinand">His Majesty</person> particularly wished once more to see the admirable <location country="England">British</location>
uniform:" would I come in _kleine Uniform_; meanwhile, to put me quite
at my ease, H.M. had commanded the Court also to wear undress. I showed
this to <person name="Sir_George">Sir George</person>, who laughed and said, "<person name="Ian_Hamilton">He</person> is too sharp; <person name="Ian_Hamilton">he</person> has done
us; you must go now--there is no help for it." So I went in my grubby
blue serge and found <person name="Ferdinand">Ferdinand</person> and the whole of <person name="Ferdinand">his</person> Court blazing with
orders in the fullest of full dress!</p>

<p>_25th September, 1915._ To <location bay="Anzac">Anzac</location> in the <location ship="H.M.S. Arno">_Arno_</location>. <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdie</person> met me and we
walked along the lower part of the left of the <location country="Australia">Australia</location> trenches until
we reached the <location country="New Zealand">New Zealanders</location> and were joined by <person name="Godley">Godley</person>. Lunched with
<person name="Inglefield">General Inglefield;</person> then plodded through the trenches held by <person name="Inglefield">his</person>
Division (the <unit type="division">54th</unit>; nice-looking boys) and by the <location country="India">Indian</location> Brigade. On the
left of the <location country="India">Indian</location> Brigade I was met by <person name="Peyton">Peyton</person> who did pilot to me
through the Scottish Horse section. The Bard joined us here and was in
great form, full of administrative good works as in <location country="South Africa">South Africa</location>. The
Scottish Horse are as keen as schoolboys out for their first shoot. They
were very proud of themselves and of the effect their rifles with
telescopic sights had produced when put into the hands of gillies and
deer stalkers, and at every twenty yards or so there was a Scottish
Horseman looking along his sights, finger on trigger, and by his side a
spotter whose periscope was fixed on the opposite loophole. The moment a
<location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> shadow darkened the loophole the word was given, the bullet
sped. Not a very big mark a loophole at over 100 yards but they got it,
they said, one try out of three.</p>

<p>At the end of the Scottish Horse we came to the Worcester Yeomanry
trench. But time was up[12] and I had to make tracks for <location bay="Anzac">Anzac</location> where we
had tea with <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdie</person>, who had stuck to us throughout the tour. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location> by
dinner-time. The quietest day, bar none, we have had on the <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Peninsula</location>
since we first landed. Not a shot was fired anywhere except by our own
snipers.</p>

<entry>
<p>_26th September, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ Last night, after dinner, <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person>
came across with a black piece of news in <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">his</person> pocket:--</p>



<p>"(No. 8229, cipher). From <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Earl Kitchener</person> to General Sir <person name="Ian_Hamilton">Ian Hamilton</person>. On
account of the mobilization of the Bulgarian Army <location country="Greece">Greece</location> has asked the
Allies to send a force to <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> in order to enable her to support
<location country="Serbia">Serbia</location> should the latter be attacked by <location country="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</location>, as well as by German
forces from the North. No doubt you realize that if by such action
<location country="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</location> joins hands with the Central Powers they will have a clear road
to <location town="Constantinople">Constantinople</location> and <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location>, and be able to send large quantities
of ammunition or troops, rendering your position very hazardous.</p>

<p>"Both <location country="France">France</location> and ourselves have promised to send between us the troops
asked for, viz., 150,000 men, and urgency is essential. It is evident
that under these circumstances some troops will have to be taken from
the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> to go to <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location>, but it must be clearly understood
that there is no intention of withdrawing from the <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Peninsula</location> or of
giving up the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> operations until the Turks are defeated. Your
 taff officer has suggested to me that you saw no difficulty in reducing
the length of your line and concentrating your forces by withdrawing
from the position now held around <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay to the neighbourhood of the
Kaiajik Aghala position whence a line might be drawn to the sea.</p>

<p>"Before the situation was changed by the <location country="Bulgaria">Bulgarians'</location> action we
considered that, owing to the marshy nature of the country now occupied
at <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> and the approaching winter, this reduction of front would be
strategically advantageous. Hence my telegram No. 8162 to which your No.
M.F. 664 replies.</p>

<p>"An offensive along practically the whole line in <location country="France">France</location> has now
commenced. The infantry are attacking to-day. Far-reaching results are
anticipated which, if secured, should greatly affect your situation.</p>

<p>"The projected dispatch of reinforcements of French and <location country="England">British</location>
divisions for Asiatic operations must be in abeyance until a decision
in the Western theatre can be reached. The troops now at the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location>
which are required for <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> would be two divisions, preferably the
<unit type="division">Xth</unit> and <unit type="division">XIth</unit>. The French would also have to withdraw either a brigade or
a division from their force at <location country="Greece">Helles</location> for the same purpose. The Yeomanry
now _en route_ to you would also have to be diverted to <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> and we
should have to arrange to mount them from <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> after their arrival.</p>

<p>"Cable me at once your ideas as to meeting these requirements. The
<location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> Committee consider a withdrawal from <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> to be advisable
under the circumstances, but they had not seen your telegram No. 664. We
have been asked to send the 15-inch howitzer, now on board ship at
<location town="Mudros">Mudros</location>, to <location town="Belgrade">Belgrade</location> as soon as possible."</p>

<p>Amen--so be it! Our mighty stroke at the vitals of the enemy is to break
itself to pieces against the Balkans. God save the King! May the Devil
fly away with the whole of the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> Committee!!</p>

<p>What arguments--what pressure--I wonder can have moved <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> to swap horse
in mid-<location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location>? In December <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> as good as told me <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">I</person> was "for it" if
the day should come along for <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person> New Army to help the <location country="Serbia">Serbians.</location> G.H.Q.
in <location country="France">France</location> had belittled <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person> effort to create it; they had tried to throw
cold water on it (the New Army) and now we should see how they liked it
going to <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location>! The reason why <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person>, at that time, turned the project
down was <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person> view that one Army Corps was too small a force to launch
into those regions of great armies and that, if the <location country="Germany">Germans</location> turned
seriously in that direction, it would be gobbled up. But two Army Corps
would starve, seeing we had no pack transport and that the railway would
only feed 40,000 men. Nor had we any mountain guns. In February <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person>
resurrected the question but that time <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> was put off by the typhus.
"Whatever destroys my New Army," he said, "it shall not be the <location country="Serbia">Serbian</location>
lice." Now he cables as if <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> was being quite consistent and sensible,
_now_, when in every aspect, the odds have turned against the
undertaking. As to the <location country="Bulgaria">Bulgarians</location> having "a clear road to <location town="Constantinople">Constantinople</location>
and <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location>" my memorable dinner with <person name="Ferdinand">Ferdinand</person>, and <person name="Ferdinand">his</person> insistence on
<person name="Ferdinand">his</person> "pivotal" position, makes me perfectly certain that the bones of no
<location country="Bulgaria">Bulgarian</location> grenadier will fertilize the <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Peninsula</location>--whatever happens. And
if the inconceivable were conceivable and <person name="Ferdinand">Ferdinand</person> were to work for
anything but <person name="Ferdinand">his</person> own immediate gain--there is no room for them here!
That fact is cast iron. The <location country="Turkey">Turkish Empire</location> is _here_ in full force.
<person name="Enver_Pasha">Enver</person> can't feed more! These numbers cause us no alarm. Since the last
abortive effort of the <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> Command to get their men to attack every
soldier in the trenches knows well that the enemy are afraid of us. They
dare not attack, they will not attack, and they cannot attack. We know
that quite well. If <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> would only come out here <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> would realize that
the Turk has lost his sting. I don't mean to say <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> is not still a
formidable fellow to turn out of <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person> trench, but <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> can't attack any
more: and that is just the moment we have chosen to sit down and do
nothing; now, when the enemy has been brought to a standstill!</p>

<p>During my absence <person name="Bailloud">Bailloud</person> has wired saying <person name="Bailloud">he</person> had received orders from
<person name="Bailloud">his</person> own Minister of War to arrange for sending away one Division of the
C.E.O. and <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person> has cabled the startling news to our S. of S. for
War.</p>

<p>Well, well. If the Greeks and ourselves are going to push through the
mountains to help the Serbs to hold <location town="Belgrade">Belgrade</location> and the line of the Danube,
why then, no doubt, we are embarking upon something that would be fine
were it feasible--something more hopeful than sitting at <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> and in
its salubrious suburbs, the "political" advantages of which were
preached to us by <person name="Napier">Napier</person>.</p>

<p>But let no man hereafter talk of <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> adventures. _Mon Dieu!_</p>

<p>Once again see the dupes of maps preparing to dash out their brains, or
rather the brains of others, against the rocks. If only <person name="Joffre">Joffre</person> and <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person>
had looked at <location town="Belgrade">Belgrade</location> over the guns of an <location country="Austria">Austrian</location> Battery in <location town="Semlin">Semlin</location>,
as I did in 1909! The line of the Danube is untenable except by a very
large force against the very large forces that can, and will, be brought
against it and there is no Fleet there to feed a large force. Also, the
communications of such a defending force will not only be mechanically
rotten but will also be strategically at the tender mercy of the most
cunning Prince in Europe. We may think we have squared <person name="Ferdinand">Ferdinand</person>. But it
is easier to square the circle than square a fox.</p>

<p>On the Danube, the Central Powers can put _and keep_ six men to our one,
_unless_ we control the river from its mouth to <location town="Belgrade">Belgrade</location>. This we can
only do by forcing the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location>.</p>

<p>After outlining an answer for <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person> to draft, I started off at
10.45 for <location bay="Anzac">Anzac</location> and <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location>. With me were <person name="Taylor">Taylor</person>, <person name="Gascoigne">Gascoigne</person>, <person name="Moore">Lieutenant
Moore</person> and <person name="Freddie">Freddie</person>. From Anzac I walked along the old communication
trench for a couple of miles, and then went round General <person name="Taylor">Taylor</person>'s
Brigade along the front by <location mountain="Green Hill">Green Hill</location> and the <location mountain="Chocolate Hills">Chocolate Hills</location>. The heat
was very exhausting.</p>

<p>Yesterday's calm has proved to be the prelude to an attempted storm. At
5 a.m. there was a big bombardment of the front line trenches, and the
Turks made a gesture of defiance. The gesture did not go beyond fixing
bayonets and shouting "Allah!" and the only result has been to render
<location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> more convinced than ever that the Turks are absolutely fed up.</p>

<p>After invigorating myself with a good draught of regimental spirit, set
forth to walk back to Anzac. Half way I halted at the <location country="India">Indian</location> Brigade
Headquarters, and, on the invitation of the hospitable <person name="Palin">Colonel Palin</person>,
had a square meal. Met <person name="Allanson">Allanson</person>, the brave commander of the <unit type="division">6th Gurkhas</unit>;
<person name="Allanson">Allanson</person> who scaled the heights of <location heights="Sari Bair">Sari Bair</location> and entered for a few
hectic hours into the promised land. Oh, what a wonderful adventure <person name="Allanson">his</person>
has been! To have seen the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> and their defences lying flat at
<person name="Allanson">his</person> feet! To feel--as <person name="Allanson">he</person> says <person name="Allanson">he</person> did--that <person name="Allanson">he</person> held the whole <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location>
Army by the throat!</p>

<p>To-day's inspection has once more brought me into personal touch with
the perfect confidence felt both at <location bay="Anzac">Anzac</location> and <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> in the
demoralization of the Turks. This has nerved me to cable agreeing to
spare the <unit type="division">10th</unit> and <unit type="division">53rd</unit> Divisions from <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> as well as a Brigade of
French from <location country="Greece">Helles</location> and four and a half Brigades of <location country="England">British</location> Field
Artillery:--</p>



<p>"(No. M.F. 675). From General Sir <person name="Ian_Hamilton">Ian Hamilton</person> to Secretary of State for
War. Reference your No. 8229. Let me begin by saying that I quite
realize that, to you, playing for your large stakes, the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location>
operation may temporarily become of a secondary nature. In spite of the
<location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> scheme I am, however, particular to note that it is not
intended to withdraw from the <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location> Peninsula, nor to give up here
until the Turks are beaten. Bearing this in mind it becomes my duty to
point out the objection to the abandonment of <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay, the
consequences of which at this stage would, I consider, be so grave that
I am warranted in running much risk to get you your two divisions by
other means. The situation has greatly changed since I first suggested
the possibility of abandoning the Bay, and its abandonment at this stage
would, I feel convinced, enormously accentuate the difficulties of any
subsequent attempt to capture the Narrows; unless, as a result of our
landing troops at <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location>, <location country="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</location> were induced to side with us and
not against us. Even when I told you in my No. M.F. 578 of 23rd August
that the diminution of my forces might compel me to contract my line, I
could not view the project without misgiving, in spite of the fact
that, at that time, I had landed few reinforcements and little artillery
in the new zone, and my views are not rightly interpreted when it is
said that I saw no great difficulty in the enterprise. After I had
received the reassuring news of reinforcements I sent you my No. M.F.
589 of 26th August and I have from that date been pouring in large
quantities of reinforcements and supplies in anticipation of winter, and
have landed a large additional amount of artillery. Therefore, I could
not hurriedly evacuate the Bay without sacrificing the majority of
supplies and warlike stores. I might also have very considerable losses,
for the Turks, who were previously 700 yards away, are now within
bombing distance in places. They have a large number of guns in the
northern zone and a retirement could only be effected under heavy fire,
which with unseasoned troops would make the retreat a hazardous one. As
explained in my No. M.F. 664 evacuation of the Bay would involve with it
the _eventual_ evacuation of all but the original <location bay="Anzac">Anzac</location> position. But
even if this last step were not necessary the withdrawal of <location country="England">British</location>
soldiers from <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> would be an overwhelming victory for the Turks. Our
position in the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> would be entirely altered for the worse and
even the effect of our landing of troops at <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> might be discounted
in <location country="Bulgaria">Bulgarian</location> eyes. At the present moment the <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> commissariat
difficulties and tales of starving families which the wounded bring back
from <location town="Constantinople">Constantinople</location> are having a bad effect on their _moral_ and the
number of desertions is on the increase. Two <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> attempts at the
offensive have broken down completely during the last week as their
troops refused to leave cover. If I give ground the <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> _moral_ will
immediately recover and instead of containing over 60,000 Turks in the
Northern Zone there would be large numbers set free to go elsewhere. All
these arguments seem to prove plainly that to evacuate a yard of <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location>
would be a most serious, and might prove a disastrous step. I would
therefore prefer to run the risk of holding the line defensively with
fewer troops in order to spare two divisions for the new enterprise.</p>

<p>"I have at present one division in Corps Reserve at <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> and the <unit type="division">1st
Australian Division</unit> resting at <location town="Mudros">Mudros</location> and also one brigade resting at
<location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>. By bringing the tired <location country="Australia">Australians</location> back and making them replace
the Mounted Division in the section north of Susak Kuyu I could spare
<unit type="division">Xth</unit> and <unit type="division">LIIIrd</unit> Divisions or else <unit type="division">Xth</unit> and <unit type="division">XIth.</unit> I could also spare one
French brigade from Cape <location country="Greece">Helles</location> without replacing it by troops from
<location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location>, and a total of 4-1/2 <location country="England">British</location> Field Artillery brigades. This would
at any rate enable me to postpone any evacuation at <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> and if the
withdrawal became necessary later on there would be less loss involved
in supplies and stores, as I could gradually make necessary preparations
for this deplorable contingency.</p>

<p>"The 15-inch howitzer is at <location city="Alexandria">Alexandria</location> and can be sent whenever you
desire on the receipt of instructions. To-morrow I am having a
conference here with the Corps Commanders concerned to consider the
details. I hope that you realize that though the IXth Corps consists of
<unit type="division">Xth</unit>, <unit type="division">XIth</unit> and <unit type="division">XIIIth</unit> Divisions there are attached to it <unit type="division">LIIIrd Welsh
Division</unit>, Mounted Division and <unit type="division">XXIXth</unit> Division, and I therefore
sincerely trust you will not contemplate the withdrawal of the Corps
Staff and Corps Commander to accompany the two divisions destined for
<location city="Salonika">Salonika</location>, for I have absolutely no one to replace them."</p>

across from <location town="Chanak">Chanak</location> and dropped four bombs on our Headquarters; all wide;
no damage. At 11 o'clock <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdwood</person> and <person name="Gen.Byng">Byng</person> came over for a confab on the
last upset. Both Generals went word by word through my M.F. 657 of the
26th September,--(1) as to drawing in our horns at <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location>,--(2) as to our
power of holding on after we lose the <unit type="division">10th</unit> and <unit type="division">53rd</unit> Divisions. They
concur in my cables and are emphatic as to the futility of making a gift
of ground to any enemy who are shaking in their shoes. What the Turks
want is a gift, not of ground but of high explosive shell. A few
thousand pounds worth of that and <person name="Gen.Byng">Byng</person> would go ahead and settle their
hash for good. <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdie</person> stayed to lunch during which meal I got a message
from <person name="Bailloud">Bailloud</person> telling me flat that <person name="Ian_Hamilton">he</person> had orders from <person name="Ian_Hamilton">his</person> Government to
get one Division over to <location town="Mudros">Mudros</location> forthwith. As long as I am in command no
soldier but myself shall handle the troops entrusted to me. I have sent
the following reply:--"Sorry that as my orders already telegraphed to
you this morning are specific, I cannot permit any movement of troops
away from the Peninsula pending further instructions."</p>

<p><person name="Ross">Ross</person> and <person name="Nevinson">Nevinson</person> (Press Correspondents), who have been away on a jaunt,
called on me and had tea. <person name="William_Percy">Lord William Percy</person> and <person name="Walter_Barttelot">Sir Walter Barttelot</person>
dined.</p>

<p>_28th September, 1915._ Office. At midnight an enemy aeroplane let us
have a taste of <person name="Ian_Hamilton">his</person> high explosive--no harm done. At 10.30 this morning
another came over and dropped a couple of bombs into the aerodrome close
by--two men hit.</p>

<p>Colonel <person name="Dorling">Dorling</person> reported himself to me as Senior Paymaster.</p>

<p>A cable from <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> saying <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> is glad to meet me as to holding on at <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location>.
<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">He</person> agrees in fact that to draw in our horns would merely set free six
<location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> Divisions to attack us elsewhere. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">He</person> agrees also with my choice
of Divisions for <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location>. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> seems astonished at the behaviour of the
French Government in sending tactical orders direct to <person name="Bailloud">Bailloud</person>. Most
extraordinary, <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> calls it. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">He</person> wants <person name="Gen.Byng">Byng</person> to go to <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> and winds up
gloriously by telling me of the great things they are doing in <location country="France">France</location>;
that, up to the present, 23,000 prisoners and over 40 guns have been
taken, and that <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> hopes there are more of each to follow. This fine
success, <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> says, should help us along in the East. So it should. I have
cabled the good news across and ordered a _feu de joie_ to be fired
everywhere on the Peninsula in honour of the victory. The ball was
opened at <location country="Greece">Helles</location> at 7 p.m., the Turks replied vigorously with every gun
and rifle they could bring to bear, and rarely, I imagine, has a
"furious joy" expressed itself more furiously.</p>

<p>Nowhere in the Empire has this fine victory brought more heartfelt
relief and joy than at the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location>: to have been brought to a
standstill, for the third time of asking, for _nothing_; that was the
fear which had haunted us.</p>

<p>_29th September, 1915._ Work. At 11 a.m. tore myself away from my papers
to play principal part in a gay little ceremony. Outside my office a
guard of honour of Surrey Yeomanry, Naval Division and <location country="Australia">Australians</location>
formed three sides of a square. <person name="Bertier">Bertier</person>, de <person name="la_Borde">la Borde</person> and <person name="Pelliot">Pelliot</person> were
led in smiling like brides going up to the altar, and, after a tiny
speech, I decorated the first with the D.S.O. and the other two with the
Military Cross. All three Officers are most popular, and there were loud
cheers. De <person name="la_Borde">la Borde</person> had tea and <person name="Mitchell">Mitchell</person> came in at the same time to say
good-bye. We are all distressed at losing <person name="Mitchell">Mitchell</person>. <person name="Mitchell">He</person> is a very fine
specimen of the sailor of the modern school. Efficient, modest, untiring
at <person name="Mitchell">his</person> work. <person name="Mitchell">He</person> has collaborated in the most loyal and devoted manner
with the G.S., and I don't know how we should ever have got on without
him.</p>

<p><person name="Nevinson">Nevinson</person>, the Correspondent, came again with <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person>, the Press Censor.
<person name="Nevinson">Nevinson</person> wants to find out whether it would be worth <person name="Nevinson">his</person> while to go to
<location city="Salonika">Salonika</location>. I would like to lend him a hand for <person name="Nevinson">he</person> is such a nice fellow,
but the matter is about as secret as can be, and I don't feel myself
free to say much. The Captains of H.M.S. <location ship="H.M.S. Cornwall">_Cornwall_</location> and <location ship="H.M.S. Cornwallis">_Cornwallis_</location>
dined; also <person name="Samson">Flight Commander Samson</person> and <person name="Ward">Ward</person>, King's Messenger. The last
named starts to-morrow night and carried off with him my letter to <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person>
Amongst other things I write:--"In the cables which have passed between
us, I have found it anything but an easy business to strike the happy
mean between executing <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">your</person> wishes promptly and cheerfully on the one
hand, and, on the other, giving <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">you</person> a faithful impression of how we
should stand here once <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">your</person> orders had been carried out.</p>

<p>"If I make too little of the dangers which surround me, then you may be
encouraged to weaken me still further, thereby jeopardizing the whole of
this enterprise. But if I allow my anxieties to get too much the upper
hand, why then I may be ruining some larger enterprise, the bearing of
which I have no means of gauging."</p>

<p>I then explain the situation and wind up:--"In the small hours of the
morning, before I have had my matutinal cup of tea, the immediate
outlook gives me a feeling of cold feet in a more aggravated form than I
have hitherto experienced. The whole plan of the French Asiatic
subsidiary operation has gone, for the meantime, by the board. <location country="England">England</location>
and <location country="France">France</location> between them cannot find men enough, I should think, to send
considerable forces to Asia as well as run an entirely new show
elsewhere. Indeed, Naval requirements alone would seem entirely to
forbid it. But I must not worry you any more with surmises. After all,
nothing great in this world was ever easily accomplished. Never has
there been such an example of that as in the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> Expedition. How
many times has success seemed to be on the point of crowning our
efforts, and yet, on each occasion, just as we are beginning to see
light through the tangle of obstacles, preparing for an assault, or
whatever it may be, something occurs to upset the apple-cart. None the
less we do advance, and we will succeed in the end. I feel I am playing
it rather low down inflicting on you the outline of my own trouble at a
moment when your own must be infinitely greater.</p>

<p>"Reading over this letter which I have not now time to re-write or
correct, it strikes me that in concentrating my mind purely on the
<location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> I may have given a wrong impression of my general attitude
towards your latest demand. No one can realize, I believe, more clearly
than I do that the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> operations themselves hinge for their
success to a very large extent upon the maintenance of a barrier between
the Central Powers and <location town="Constantinople">Constantinople</location>. As far as reinforcements of men
to the enemy in the field are concerned, such inter-communication would
not be so fatal as might perhaps be imagined. The <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location> Peninsula is
a limited area, and if the <location country="Germany">>Germans</location> had a million men at <location town="Constantinople">Constantinople</location>
they could not, under present conditions, add many, if any, to the
numbers already opposed to us. But the free transit of coal, flour,
ammunition and big guns might well put us all in the cart--the cart
being in this instance, the sea."</p>

<p>My A.D.C. has brought me an irritated message from the A.G., War
Office:--</p>



<p>"<person name="Ian_Hamilton">Your</person> No. M.F.A. 4003 of the 24th instant. Are <person name="Ian_Hamilton">you</person> aware that <person name="Ian_Hamilton">your</person>
telegram was really a demand for 60,000 men with a weekly supply in
addition. We do not see how to meet such large numbers in view of the
present situation in <location country="France">France</location>. Have the numbers at Base, <location city="Alexandria">Alexandria</location>, and
men returning from hospital, etc., been taken into account? Please state
what are <person name="Ian_Hamilton">your</person> minimum requirements to carry on with."</p>

<p>Am I aware, etc.? Why certainly; _and so is the A.G._ To ignore facts is
one thing; to be ignorant of them is another. These facts are, or should
be, the daily bread of his Department. I resent this surprise; it is not
genuine. If, as the A.G. says, they have not got the men to send, why in
God's name do they go on telling the people they _have_ got them?</p>

<p>Have drafted out this answer:--</p>



<p>"A.G. My telegram No. M.F.A. 4003 told you the number required to bring
and keep all formations up to establishment and, as an estimate, the
numbers given therein are accurate. There is nothing new in that
telegram; it is only the culmination of many demands, the deficiency,
which was serious enough before, being aggravated by the prevailing
epidemic. I took into account the numbers in Base depots and men
returning from hospital. I certainly hope that there may be a decrease
in the sick rate and that there will be an increase in the numbers
returning from hospital, but that cannot make any difference to my
present shortage of establishment though it would affect the strength of
monthly drafts required.</p>

<p>"I would like further to point out that only 750 of the 20,000 drafts
now coming are for the Territorial Force, the remainder being for the
Regulars. Hence assuming that wastage will be equally distributed over
all the eight divisions, the estimated shortage of 30,490 on 9th October
will be constituted as follows:--Four Territorial Force divisions,
26,583; four Regular divisions, 3,907.</p>

<p>"When my No. M.F.A. 4003 was sent no question had arisen of denuding my
force for a fresh expedition elsewhere. I fully realize that you cannot
send what does not exist and I will do the best possible with what you,
knowing my situation, are able to send; but I do not consider that it is
possible to view my position in winter with any equanimity unless I am
to receive substantial drafts and unless a normal flow of reinforcements
for all divisions can be arranged so as to counter the difficulties that
are inherent in keeping a force operating so far from <location country="England">England</location> up to
establishment."</p>

<p>_30th September, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ Peace on the Peninsula; trouble at
G.H.Q. The <unit type="division">10th Division</unit> is taking its departure from <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> undisturbed
by the enemy. Not a shot is being fired. Some say this denotes
extraordinary skill in the conduct of the withdrawal; others,
extraordinary delight on the part of the Turks to see them clearing
out. I don't believe in either theory. The Turks have been fought to a
standstill and there is no attack left in them--not under _any_
circumstances or temptation; that is what I believe in my heart,
otherwise I would refuse point blank to strip myself of two full
divisions under their noses. Still, it is nervous work presuming to this
extent upon their fatigue and I will not agree to the <unit type="division">53rd</unit> going too, as
the loss of three Divisions would leave an actual hole in our line.
Meanwhile, it is a relief to hear that the move is going on just like
peacetime. As to G.H.Q., all is held up by uncertainty. Our whole
enterprise hangs still in the balance. No date for the sailing of our
troops for <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> can yet be fixed, and we may get them back. Am glued
to the cable terminus waiting, waiting, waiting. I have agreed to let
the 2nd Brigade of the French go!</p>

<p>This cable sent to-day to <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> explains itself:--</p>



<p>"The following has just been received from <person name="Bailloud">Bailloud</person>:--'I have the honour
to inform you that I have received a telegram from the French Minister
of War ordering me (1) to embark one division of the Corps
Expéditionnaire immediately for <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location>; (2) to organize this division,
which will be placed under my command, into two brigades of Metropolitan
Infantry with two groups of 75 mm., one group of mountain artillery, one
battery of 125 mm. howitzer and four 120 mm. guns. I am taking steps to
execute this order and to hold the present section of the French line
with the force remaining in the Peninsula, which will be placed under
General Brulard.'</p>

<p>"I said in my telegram No. M.F. 675, that I could only spare one brigade
of the <location country="France">French.</location> I desire to place on record that if this order of the
<location country="France">French Government</location> is carried out the <unit type="division">">LIIIrd</unit> Division cannot possibly be
spared without seriously endangering the safety of this force and the
whole future of the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> enterprise. Even if I were to keep the
<unit type="division">LIIIrd Division</unit> it would not relieve me of intense anxiety. The fact
will not escape your notice that the division to go is being
re-constructed so that nothing but European troops are included, thus
leaving an undue proportion of <location country="Senegal">Senegalese.</location> This constitutes such a grave
danger that, if I had the power, I would refuse to allow <person name="Bailloud">Bailloud</person> to
carry out this order of <person name="Bailloud">his</person> Government. It need hardly be pointed out
that all your hopes of success in the Balkans would be upset by a
disaster at Cape <location country="Greece">Helles</location>. Even when I said that I could spare one French
Infantry Brigade the Commander of the VIIIth Corps, who is one of the
last men in the Army to express alarmist views, represented to me, in
view of the physical condition of a large proportion of <person name="Ian_Hamilton">his</person> troops, the
gravity of the case in the strongest terms."</p>

<p>A reminder of mine _re_ the Ashmead-Bartlett incident has drawn an
amusing and highly unexpected answer from the War Office:--</p>



<p>"<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person> was found to be carrying a despatch for the Prime Minister
criticizing military operations in <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location>. <person name="Murdoch">He</person> carried nothing for
Lawson."</p>

<p>I could not help laughing heartily at the blue looks of <person name="Tyyrell">Tyrrell</person>, the
Head of our Intelligence. After all, this is <person name="Mr.Asquith">Asquith's</person> own affair. I do
not for one moment believe <person name="Mr.Asquith">Mr.Asquith</person> would employ such agencies and
for sure <person name="Mr.Asquith">he</person> will turn <person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person> and <person name="Ian_Hamilton">his</person> wares into the wastepaper basket.
I have reassured <person name="Tyyrell">Tyrrell</person>. Tittle-tattle will effect no lodgment in the
<person name="Mr.Asquith">Asquithian</person> brain.</p>

<p><person name="Lt._Moore">Lieutenant Moore</person> from the Military Secretary's office in <location city="London">London</location> dined.
<person name="Moore">He</person> has been useful to us. During the night there was rain and heavy fog.
The evacuation of <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> by the <unit type="division">10th</unit> Division goes on without the
smallest hitch and is almost finished--all except the guns. Whether the
Turks have fallen asleep or only closed an eye is the question of the
hour but <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdwood's</person> Intelligence are certain they are stone cold and
cannot be dragged to the attack.</p>
</entry>

<entry>
<p>_1st October, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ S. of S. cables he will not overlook <person name="Ian_Hamilton">our</person>
wants in the matter of ammunition but that "at the present moment all he
can get has to be sent to <location country="France">France</location>." I have thanked him. Not a word from
<location country="France">France</location> since we fired the _feu de joie_.</p>

<p><person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> believes in the East and sends shell to the West. The reason is that
<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person>'s _beliefs_ are only intuitions; <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> believes in the same sort of way
that <person name="Elijah">Elijah</person> knew certain things.</p>

<p>The principle underlying the world war seems to me this:--that wherever
the new system of trenches, dug-outs, barbed wire, can reach its fullest
development, _there_ we should prefer the defensive. Wherever this new
system cannot be fully developed, there the old ideas hold good and
there are the theatres for the offensive. In <location country="France">France</location> and <location town="Flanders">Flanders</location> where
both sides are within a few hours' run, on good railways, from their own
chief arsenals and depôts the new system attains prodigious power. In
the <location country="Turkey">Turkish Empire</location> almost all the conditions; railways, material,
factories, etc., are favourable to the old and unfavourable to the new
conditions.</p>

<p>To me these views appear as clear as crystal and as unanswerable as
Euclid. The tenacity of the new system of defence; the pressure of
<location country="France">France</location>; the apathy of a starved military opinion; the fact that all our
most powerful soldiers are up to their necks in the West, combine to
keep us ramming our heads against the big pile of barbed wire instead of
getting through by the gate called strait.</p>

<p>Next <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person> with the following electrical bombshell:--</p>



<p>"By <person name="Bailloud">Bailloud</person>'s report I see that <person name="Ian_Hamilton">he</person> considers that the French line can
be held by one division. If, on reconsideration, you agree with this
view can you spare the <unit type="division">LIIIrd</unit> Division?"</p>

<p><person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> has pounced like a hawk on <person name="Bailloud">Bailloud</person>'s statement (which I cabled to
him yesterday) that <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> is taking steps for Brulard to hold the French
section with one division.</p>

<p>Have answered:--</p>



<p>"(No. M.F. 703). From General Sir <person name="Ian_Hamilton">Ian Hamilton</person> to <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Earl Kitchener</person>. Your
No. 8409, cipher. Not one word of my No. M.F. 693 can I take back. The
situation at Cape <location country="Greece">Helles</location> cannot be fully realized. May I remind you that
when on 20th August I moved the <unit type="division">XXIXth</unit> Division to <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location>, I left at Cape
<location country="Greece">Helles</location> only the minimum garrison compatible with safety. Since that date
the total <location country="England">British</location> troops there have decreased in strength from 15,300 to
13,300 rifles, and now I am losing a French composite division which is
made up of the only troops of the Corps Expéditionnaire on whom I can
rely, as well as 44 guns. It is my considered opinion that to leave
protection of Cape <location country="Greece">Helles</location> to one division of Colonial troops, plus
13,300 worn-out <location country="England">British</location> Territorials and Naval Volunteers, is running
too serious a risk. To-day, therefore, I am moving one brigade of <unit type="division">XXIXth</unit>
Division back from <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> to reinforce VIIIth Corps in order to have some
regular troops there on whom I can rely. This makes it impossible to
spare the <unit type="division">LIIIrd</unit> Division. The change of opinion on the part of
<person name="Bailloud">Bailloud</person>, when <person name="Bailloud">he</person> gets away from a position which I have found it
difficult to persuade <person name="Bailloud">him</person> to hold with two divisions, and which <person name="Bailloud">he</person> now,
as <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">you</person> say, thinks can be held with one division composed largely of
blacks, is startling enough to need no comment. If you want to get at
<person name="Bailloud">his</person> real opinion, suggest that <person name="Bailloud">he</person> stays here with one division while
<person name="Brulard">Brulard</person> goes to <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location>.</p>

<p>"A despatch from <person name="Bailloud">Bailloud</person> has _just_ reached me on the situation in
French section after <person name="Bailloud">his</person> own departure with one division. It is as
follows:--</p>



<p>"'One division will then be defending our present line with an effective
strength reduced by half, and with Infantry which comprises only
Colonial contingents, half European and half native. I feel it to be my
duty to expose the situation to you in order that you may be able to
decide whether the time has not now arrived to reduce the present
section of the C.E.O., making part of it occupied by <location country="England">British</location> troops and
holding a solid reserve in rear of the Allies' first line capable of
dealing with any situation.'</p>

<p>"I believe this indicates <person name="Bailloud">Bailloud</person>'s real opinion; it is a curious
contrast to that quoted in your No. 8409, cipher, dated 30th September."</p>

<p>At 11.30 crossed to "K" and inspected the <unit type="brigade">87th Brigade</unit> of the <unit type="division">29th</unit>
Division. <person name="Lucas">Lucas</person>, of the <unit type="regiment">Berks Regiment</unit>, commanded. Saw the Border
Regiment under Colonel Pollard; then the renowned Royal Inniskilling
Fusiliers under <person name="Pierce">Major Pierce</person>, the full strength of the Battalion on
parade "all present" was 220! Next the <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person>O.S.B.s; they were under the
command of <person name="Stoney">Major Stoney</person>; last the South Wales Borderers under the
command of <person name="Cpt.Williams">Captain Williams</person>.</p>

<p>The men were in rags and looked very tired. This is the first time in
the campaign our rank and file have seemed sorry for themselves. Ten
days of rest had been promised them and now they are being hurried back
to the trenches before they have had a week. My heart goes out to them
entirely. Were I they I would feel mad with me. The breaking of my word
to the <unit type="division">29th Division</unit> has to be shouldered by me just like all the other
results of this new Balkan adventure; the withdrawal of the <location country="Ireland">Irish</location> and
the French for <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> leaves no margin of rest for what's left.</p>

<p>Inspected also the West Riding Field Company of Royal Engineers under
<person name="Major_Bayley">Major Bayley</person>, and the West Lancashire Field Ambulance.</p>

<p>A long letter from <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person> putting <person name="Maxwell">his</person> point of view about the <unit type="brigade">51st</unit> and
<unit type="brigade">53rd Sikhs</unit>. Were we both sealed-pattern Saints we'd be bound to fall
foul of one another working under so perverse a system. <person name="Maxwell">He</person> has written
me very nicely; nothing could be nicer. I have replied by return:--</p>



<p>"Yours of 24th just received. As to the wires about the 51st and 53rd
between myself and the War Office, and your remarks thereon, we stand so
much on one platform, and are faced so much by the same difficulties,
that I think it ought to be fairly easy for us to come to an
understanding in most conceivable circumstances, as indeed our
co-operation up to date has shown.</p>

<p>"If <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> goes, then I shall not last very long. If I am wiped out, I
think it will be the preface to trouble in <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>.[13]</p>

<p>"As to myself I am 60,000 below strength. I had a cable from the War
 Office a day or two ago expressing naïve astonishment at this figure. I
replied that the figure was accurate and that there was nothing new
about it as it only denoted the accumulation of a state of things which
had been continuously reported since the very first day when we started
off from <location country="England">England</location> minus the ten per cent. margin of excess given to every
unit going across to <location country="France">France</location>. This is the essential cause of our repeated
failure to make that last little push which just differentiates partial
from conclusive success. In every case this has been so. Had I been able
to throw in my ten per cent. margin on the third day after landing,
there is no doubt in the world we would have got right up on to <location heights="Achi Baba">Achi
Baba.</location> Afterwards, each engagement we fought, although our total numbers
may have been largely increased, the old formations were always at half
strength or something less. However, I won't bother you about this as
your time is too precious to enter into 'might-have-beens' and so is
mine.</p>

<p>"Meantime, my line is very, very thin, and the men are getting entirely
worn out. In the midst of this I am called upon to send away two
Divisions, the French and the <location country="Ireland">Irish</location>, to ---- you know where. I have done
so without a murmur, although it puts me into a ticklish position.
Reinforcements are now to be diverted elsewhere and my command is not an
enviable one. I quite understand the necessity of trying to maintain a
barrier between <location town="Essen">Essen</location> and <location town="Constantinople">Constantinople</location>. I quite understand also the
danger of doing so at the expense of this attenuated, exhausted force. I
have represented the facts home, and it is for them to decide."</p>

<p>Dined with the Admiral.</p>

<p>_2nd October, 1915._ The despatch of the <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> force and their outfit
are absorbing all my energies. Our whole Expeditionary Force is being
drawn upon to send the <unit type="division">10th Division</unit> creditably turned out to the new
theatre. The twenty-four hours' delay caused by the political crisis at
<location city="Athens">Athens</location> has been a godsend in enabling me to reclothe and re-equip the
detachment from top to toe. The supplies for my own force are now
exhausted, but,--on the principle of the starving garrison who threw
loaves over the ramparts at the besiegers, we must try and make a good
first impression on the Greeks.</p>

by every word <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> had said. What <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> "had said," was that any withdrawal
from the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> must react in due course upon Islam, and especially
upon <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>. Cairo, <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> held to be the centre of the Mahomedan doctrine
and the pivotal point of our great Mahomedan Imperium. An evacuation of
the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> would serve as an object lesson to <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> just as our
blunders in the <location peninsula="Crimea">Crimea</location> had served as a motive to the <location country="India">Indian</location> mutineers.
Ultimate success was not the point in either case. The point was that
the legend of the invincibility of <location country="England">British</location> troops should be shattered in
some signal and quite unmistakable fashion. "The East," <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> said, "moved
slowly in the fifties, and it will move slowly now. We've had a
wonderful delivery but--depend upon it--the price has yet to be
paid!"--IAN H., 1920.]</p>

<p>_3rd October, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ Church Parade. Inspected escort, men of the
<person name="Howe">Howe</person> and <person name="Nelson">Nelson</person> Battalions and a contingent from the 12th Australian Infantry" and 26th
Australian Infantry. At 12.15 <person name="Bailloud">Bailloud</person>, <person name="Brulard">Brulard</person> and <person name="Girodon">Girodon</person> arrived from
<location town="Mudros">Mudros</location> for a last conference. Everything is fixed up. We are going to
help the derelict division of French in every way we can. <person name="Bailloud">Bailloud</person>, for
<person name="Bailloud">his</person> part, promises to leave them their fair share of guns and trench
mortars. Whenever I see him I know <person name="Bailloud">he</person> is one of the best fellows in the
world. We went down and waved farewells from the pier. <person name="Bailloud">He</person> was quite
frank. <person name="Bailloud">He</person> does not think the Allies have either the vision or the heart
to go through with <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location>: <person name="Bailloud">he</person> begins to suspect that the big push on
the Western Front is going to yield no laurels: so <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> hits <person name="Bailloud">his</person>
fancy.</p>

<p>Lieutenants Weston and Schemallach of the <location country="Australia">Australians</location> and Lieutenant
Gellibrand of the Naval Division lunched. A <person name="Mr._Unsworth">Mr. Unsworth</person> came to talk
over gifts for the <location country="Australia">Australia</location> troops. <person name="Mr._Unsworth">He</person> seems a capital chap; full of
go and goodwill to all men.</p>

<entry>
<p>_4th October, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ Vague warnings have taken shape in an
event. A cable from <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> telling me to decipher the next message myself. I
have not drafted out an average of fifty telegrams a day for <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> for
six months at a stretch without knowing something of <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person> _modus
scribendi_. The Staff were pleasantly excited at the idea that some new
move was in the wind. I knew the new move--or thought I did.</p>

<p>Well, not that: not exactly that; not this time. But the enemies of our
enterprise have got our range to a nicety and have chucked their first
bomb bang into the middle of my camp.</p>

<p>A "flow of unofficial reports from <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location>," so <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> cables to me, is
pouring into the War Office. These "unofficial reports" are "in much the
same strain" (perhaps they spring from the same source?). "They
adversely criticize the work of the Headquarters Staff and complaints
are made that its members are much out of touch with the troops. The War
Office also doubt whether their present methods are quite satisfactory."
<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> therefore suggests "some important changes in your Headquarters
Staff; for instance, if you agreed, Kiggell from home to take
<person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person>'s place with you. Should you, however, decline and desire to
remain as at present, may we assume that we are quite safe in regarding
these unofficial reports as not representing the true feelings of the
troops?"</p>

<p>So----! On the face of it this cable seems to suggest that a man widely
known as a straight and capable soldier should be given the shortest of
shrifts at the instance of "unofficial reports"; i.e., camp gossip.
Surely the cable message carries with it some deeper significance!</p>

<p>I am grateful to old <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">He</person> is trying to save me. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">He</person> picked out
<person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person> himself. Not so long ago <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> cabled me in <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person> eagerness to
promote him to Major-General; <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> would not suggest substituting the
industrious Kiggell if he didn't fear for me and for the whole of this
enterprise.</p>

<p><person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> wants, so <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> says, "some important change"; that cannot mean, surely,
that <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> wants a sufficiently showy scapegoat to feed the ravenous
critics--or does it? Perhaps, <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person>'s got to gain time; breathing space
wherein to resume the scheme which was sidetracked by the offensive in
<location country="France">France</location> and smashed by the diversion to <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location>. Given time, our scheme
may yet be resumed. The Turks are in the depths. <person name="Sarrail">Sarrail</person> with <person name="Sarrail">his</person> six
divisions behind him could open the Narrows in no time. I see the plan.
<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> must have a splendid sacrifice but by the Lord they shan't have the
man who stood by me like a rock during those first ghastly ten days.</p>

<p>The new C.R.E., <person name="General_Williams">General Williams</person>, and <person name="Ellison">Ellison</person> turned up for lunch.
<person name="General_Williams">Williams</person> gave us the first authentic news we have had about those Aden
excursions and alarms.</p>

<p>An amusing aftermath of the evacuation by the French and <location country="Ireland">Irish</location>
Divisions. When the last of <person name="Bailloud">Bailloud</person>'s troops had embarked the Turks
dropped manifestoes from aeroplanes along the lines of the Senegalese
calling upon these troops to make terms and come over now that their
white comrades had left them to have their throats cut. I have cabled
this queer item to the S. of S. Evidently the enemy were quite well
aware of our withdrawal. Then _why_ didn't they shell the beaches? At
French Headquarters they believe that the Turks were so glad to see our
backs that they hardly dared breathe (much less fire a shell) lest we
should change our minds.</p>
</entry>

<entry>
  <p>_5th October, 1915._ First thing another cable from <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> saying, "<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">I</person> think
it well to let you know" that it is "quite understood by the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location>
Committee that you are adopting only a purely defensive attitude at
present." Also:--"<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">I</person> have no reason to imagine <person name="Ian_Hamilton">you</person> have any intention of
taking the offensive anywhere along the line seeing <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">I</person> have been unable
to replace your sick and wounded men." But, if <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> knows I _can't_ take
the offensive, why trouble to cable me that the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> Committee
expect me to adopt "only a purely defensive attitude"? I realize where
we stand; <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person>, <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person> and I,--on the verge. We are getting on for
two months now since the August fighting--all that time we have been
allowed to do nothing--literally, allowed to do nothing, seeing we have
been given no shell. What a fiasco! The <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> is not a sanatorium;
<location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> is not Southend. With the men we have lost from sickness in the
past six weeks we could have beaten the Turks twice over. Now Government
seem to be about to damn everything--themselves included.</p>

<p>But after all, who am I to judge the Government of the <location country="England">British Empire</location>?
What do I know of their difficulties, pledges, and enemies--whether
outside or inside the fold?</p>

<p>I have no grouse against Government or War Office--still less against
<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person>--though many hundred times have I groused.[14]</p>

<p>Freely and gratefully do I admit that the individuals have done their
best. Most of all am I indebted--very deeply indebted--to <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> for having
refrained absolutely from interference with my plan of campaign or with
the tactical execution thereof.</p>

<p>But things are happening now which seem beyond belief. That the
<location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> Committee should complacently send me a message to say we
"quite understand that you are adopting only a purely defensive
attitude at present" is staggering when put side by side with the carbon
of this, the very last cable I have sent them. "I think you should know
immediately that the numbers of sick evacuated in the IXth Corps during
the first three days of October were 500 men on the 1st instant; 735 men
on the 2nd instant and 607 men on the 3rd instant. Were this rate kept
up it would come to 45 per cent. of our strength evacuated in one
month."</p>

<p>Three quarters of this sickness is due to inaction--and now the
<location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> Committee "quite understand" I am "adopting only a purely
defensive action at present." I have never adopted a defensive attitude.
They have forced us to sit idle and go sick because--at the very last
moment--they have permitted the French offensive to take precedence of
ours, although, on the face of it, there was no violent urgency in
<location country="France">France</location> as there is here. Our men in <location country="France">France</location> were remarkably healthy; they
were not going sick by thousands. But I feel too sick myself--body and
soul--to let my mind dwell on these miseries.</p>

<p>Sealed my resolution (resignation?) by giving my answer about
<person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person>. Though the sins of my General Staff have about as much to
do with the real issues as the muddy water had to do with the death of
the argumentative lamb, I begin by pointing out to the War Office wolf
that "no Headquarters Staff has ever escaped similar criticism."</p>

<p>Grumblings are an old campaigner's _vade mecum_. Bred by inaction;
enterprise and activity smother them. A sickness of the spirit, they
are like the flies that fasten on those who stay too long in one place.
Was <person name="Doughty_Wylie">Doughty Wylie</person> "much out of touch with the troops" when <person name="Doughty_Wylie">he</person> led the
<location town="Dublin">Dublins</location>, <location town="Munster">Munsters</location> and <location town="Hampshire">Hampshires</location> up from "V" beach and fell gloriously
at their head? Was <person name="General_Williams">Williams</person> "out of touch" when <person name="General_Williams">he</person> was hit? Was <person name="Hore_Ruthven">Hore
Ruthven?</person> "As to <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person>," I say, "my confidence in that Officer is
complete. I did not select him; <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">you</person> gave him to me and I have ever since
felt most grateful to <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">you</person> for <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">your</person> choice."</p>

<p>Now--I feel better.</p>

<p>The plot thickens. A cable just come in from the S. of S. for War:--</p>



<p>"The following statement has been made in letter to Prime Minister,
<location country="Australia">Australia</location>, by Mr.<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person>: 'The fact is that after the first day at
<location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> an order had to be issued to officers to shoot without mercy any
soldier who lagged behind or loitered in advance.' Wire me as to the
truth or otherwise of this allegation."</p>

<p><person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person> must be mad. Or, is there some method in this madness?</p>

<p>Mr.<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person> was not a war correspondent; <person name="Murdoch">he</person> is purely a civilian and
could hardly have invented this "order" on <person name="Murdoch">his</person> own. No soldier could
have told <person name="Murdoch">him</person> this. Someone not a soldier--someone so interested in
discrediting the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> Campaign that he does not scruple to do so
even by discrediting our own troops must have put this invention about,
_per_ <person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person>. Doubtless we strike here upon the source of these
"unofficial statements" which have been flowing into the War Office.
All I remember of <person name="Murdoch">his</person> visit to me here is a sensible, well-spoken man
with dark eyes, who said <person name="Murdoch">his</person> mind was a blank about soldiers and
soldiering, and made me uncomfortable by an elaborate explanation of why
<person name="Murdoch">his</person> duty to <location country="Australia">Australia</location> could be better done with a pen than with a rifle.
<person name="Murdoch">He</person> was one week at the Press Correspondents' camp and spent, so they
tell me, a few hours only at Anzac and <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location>, never once crossing to
<location country="Greece">Helles</location>. If then <person name="Murdoch">his</person> letter to <person name="Murdoch">his</person> Prime Minister is a fair sample of the
grounds upon which <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person> has been condemned, Heaven help us all!</p>

<p>As a relief to these disagreeable thoughts, a Taube dropped a couple of
bombs into camp. She flew so high that she was hard to see until the
bursting shrapnel gave us her line. As she made tracks back through the
trackless blue, the ships gave her a taste of some big projectiles,
12-inches or 9.2. The aerial commotion up there must have been
considerable.</p>

<p>At noon, sailed over to <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> in H.M.S. _Savage_. We took our lunch on
board. As we came into harbour the Turks gave us a shell or two from
their field guns, then stopped. <person name="Titchfield">Young Titchfield</person>, the <person name="Duke_of_Portland">Duke of Portland's</person>
son, met us at the beach and brought us along to <person name="Gen.Byng">Byng</person>'s Headquarters,
where I met also de <person name="de_Lisle">Lisle</person> and <person name="Reed">Reed</person>. After hearing their news I started
off with the whole band to make a tour of the trenches held by the <unit type="brigade">88th</unit>
Brigade, under <person name="General_Cayley">General Cayley</person>. On the way I was taken up to "Gibraltar"
observation post to get a bird's-eye view of the line. Besides my old
friends of the <unit type="division">29th Division</unit> I saw some of the new boys, especially the
<unit type="battalion">1st Newfoundland Battalion</unit> under <person name="Colonel_Burton">Colonel Burton,</person> and the 2/1st Coy. of
the <location town="London">London</location> Regiment. This was the Newfoundlanders' first day in the
trenches and they were very pleased with themselves. They could not
understand why they were not allowed to sally forth at once and do the
Turks in. The presence of these men from our oldest colony adds to the
extraordinary mix-up of people now fighting on the <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Peninsula.</location> All the
materials exist here for bringing off the biblical coup of Armageddon
excepting only the shell.</p>

<p>In the course of these peregrinations I met <person name="Marshall">Marshall</person> of the 53rd
Division, Beresford, commanding the 86th Brigade, and Colonel Savage,
R.E.</p>

<p>After tea with <person name="Gen.Byng">Byng</person>, including the rare treat of a slice of rich cake,
we went down to our friend <location ship="H.M.S. Savage">H.M.S. _Savage_.</location> The wind had risen to a
fairly stiff gale, and the sea was beginning to get very big. Those
field gun shells had caused the <location ship="H.M.S. Savage">_Savage_</location> to lie a desperate long way out
to sea; we had a very stiff pull in the teeth of the waves, and every
one of us began to think that salt water rather than the bullet was
going to end our days. However, we just managed by the skin of our teeth
and the usual monkey tricks, to scramble up on board. As I said in my
wrath when I first stood on the firm deck, I would sooner have a hundred
shells fired at me by the Turks.</p>

<p><person name="Cpt.Davidson">"Captain Davidson</person> commanding <location ship="H.M.S. Cornwallis">H.M.S. _Cornwallis_</location> dined; everyone liked
him very much.</p>
</entry>

<entry>
<p>_6th October, 1915._ Left General Headquarters soon after 11 o'clock for
<location country="Greece">Helles</location>, taking with me Aspinall and <person name="Freddie">Freddie</person>. Lunched with <person name="Davies">Davies</person> at 8th
Corps Headquarters.</p>

<p>Afterwards rode across to Royal Naval Division and saw Paris. Then went
with <person name="Bertie_Lawrence">Bertie Lawrence</person>, commanding <unit type="division">52nd Division</unit>, to <person name="Bertie_Lawrence">his</person> lines. Our route
lay up <location heights="Achi Baba">Achi Baba</location> Nallah and along the trenches to the Horse Shoe; then
along Princes Street trench up the Vineyard, and back along the Krithia
Nallah to the Headquarters of the <unit type="brigade">156th Brigade</unit>. There we mounted our
horses and rode back to Corps Headquarters. I brought <person name="Steward">Steward</person> back with
me to dine and sleep the night. <person name="Colonel_Tyrrell">Colonel Tyrrell</person> and <person name="Major_Hunlokel">Major Hunloke</person>
(King's Messenger) also dined.</p>

</entry>

<entry>
<p>_7th October, 1915._ Wasted energy brooding over the addled eggs of the
past. Are the High Gods bringing our new Iliad to grief in a spirit of
wanton mischief? At whose door will history leave the blame for the
helpless, hopeless fix we are left in--rotting with disease and told to
take it easy?</p>

<p>That clever fellow <person name="Deedes">Deedes</person> dined; also Rowan Hamilton, son of my old
<person name="Simla">Simla</person> friend the Colonel of that name.</p>
</entry>

<entry>
<p>_8th October, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ At 11 a.m. <person name="Ellison">Ellison</person>, <person name="Taylor">Taylor</person>, <person name="Gascoigne">Gascoigne</person> and
<person name="Freddie">Freddie</person> sailed with me for <location bay="Anzac">Anzac</location>. There we lunched with the ascetic
<person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdie</person> and Staff off bully beef, biscuits and water. Then, the whole lot
of us, together with <person name="de_Crespigny">de Crespigny</person>, <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdie</person>'s Staff Officer, hurried five
miles an hour down the communication trench to the Headquarters of the
<location country="India">Indian</location> Brigade. After greetings we shoved on and saw the 2nd Lovat
Scouts under <person name="Lieutenant-Colonel_Stirling">Lieutenant-Colonel Stirling</person> and met, whilst going round
their line, <person name="Morrison_Bell">Major Morrison Bell</person> and <person name="Cpt.Oppenheim">Captain Oppenheim.</person> They seemed in
very good fettle, and it would have been hard to find a finer lot of
men. Taking leave of the 2nd Lovat Scouts, we worked along the trenches
of the Fife and Forfar Yeomanry, under Colonel <person name="Mitchell">Mitchell</person>, until we came
to the 1st Lovat Scouts under <person name="Colonel_Bailey">Colonel Bailey.</person> <person name="Lovat">Lovat</person> himself was sick,
but <person name="Peyton">Peyton</person> commanding the <unit type="division">2nd Mounted Division</unit> turned up just when the
inspection was at an end. <person name="Peyton">He</person> had got lost in the trenches, or we had.
Next time the way was lost there was no mistake as to who had made the
mistake. <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdie</person> and I were pushing along as fast as we could leg it back
towards <location bay="Anzac">Anzac</location>. In the maze of trenches we came to a dividing of the
ways. Two jolly old Sikhs were sitting at the junction. I asked if the
road to the left led to the Headquarters of the <location country="India">Indian</location> Brigade. They
said, "Yes," so on we went, I leading, <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdie</person> following. The trench got
shallower and shallower until, in a little grove of trees, it petered
out entirely. But it seemed to begin again in the other side and so we
crossed through the trees. Once there we found that the supposed trench
was only a shallow scratching up of the earth, and that we were standing
within a hundred yards of the <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> lines just about half way between
them and the Lovat Scouts! I shouted to <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdie</person> and we turned and ran for
it--for our lives, I mean. Luckily the Turks were slow at spotting us,
all except one who was a rank bad shot: so tumbling back into the
trenches from which we had emerged, we saved ourselves by the skin of
our teeth. I could not have been smarter about dodging two or three
bullets had it been the beginning of our enterprise and had the high
minarets of <location town="Constantinople">Constantinople</location> glittered before my eyes.</p>

<p>When we got back to where the two old Sikhs were sitting, as placid as
idols, <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdie</person> gave them <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">his</person> opinion of their ancestors. On reaching the
<location country="Australia">Australia</location> and <location country="New Zealand">New Zealand</location> Division we were done to a turn, but <person name="Godley">Godley</person>
revived us with tea and then we made our way back to our destroyer and
to Headquarters. It was dark when we arrived and a bad storm was setting
in--wind and rain--which went on till midnight.</p>

<p>Replies have come in to our enquiries as to Mr.<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person>'s statement to
the Prime Minister of <location country="Australia">Australia</location> that <location country="England">British</location> Officers had been ordered
to "shoot without mercy any soldier who lagged behind or loitered." As
the Secretary of State seems to take this charge seriously, I thought it
well, before I sent my answer, just to make sure that no subordinate had
said, or done, or written anything which could plausibly be twisted into
this lie. The Generals have denied indignantly; are furious, in fact, at
the double insult to their men and to themselves.</p>

<p>Have cabled accordingly:--</p>



<p>"(No. M.F.A.B. 4491). From General Sir <person name="Ian_Hamilton">Ian Hamilton</person> to Secretary of
State for War. With reference to your No. 8554 M.O. 414 of the 5th inst.
I have _pro forma_ made full enquiries and I find that there is no
truth whatever in the allegation made by <person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person>."</p>

<entry>
<p>_9th October, 1915._ Had made my _band-o-bast_ for running over to
<location country="Greece">Helles</location>, but the Vice-Admiral cabled he wanted to see me if he could at
11.45. Anyway the sea is still a bit rough for the crossing and landing.
A lot of damage was done last night to the Anzac piers, two of them
being clean washed away. Peter Pollen is off colour. <person name="Freddie">Freddie</person> and I dined
on board the _<location ship="H.M.S. Triad">Triad</location>_.</p>

<p>Whilst at dinner got full reports both from <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> and <location bay="Anzac">Anzac</location> as to the
effects of the storm. The southerly gale, which not only washed away the
piers but sunk the water lighters at <location bay="Anzac">Anzac</location>, has done no harm at <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location>
except that three motor lighters have been driven ashore. The Admiral is
clear that, during southerly gales we shall have to supply both <location bay="Anzac">Anzac</location>
and <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> by the new pier just north of Ari Burnu. The promontory is
small but last night it gave complete protection to everything in its
lea. By sinking an old ship we can turn Ari Burnu into quite a decent
little harbour.</p>
</entry>

<entry>
<p>_10th October, 1915._ Made my deferred visit to <location country="Greece">Helles</location>, going over this
morning in the <location ship="H.M.S. Arno">_Arno_</location> with <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person>, <person name="Val">Val</person> and <person name="Alec_McGrigor">Alec McGrigor</person>. Looked in
at the Clearing Hospital and cast an eye over Lancashire Landing. Then,
in company with <person name="Jimmy_Watson">Jimmy Watson</person> and <person name="Colonel_Ayres">Colonel Ayres,</person> walked up to Corps
Headquarters where we had a fine lunch with <person name="Davies">Davies</person>, <person name="de_Rougemont">de Rougemont</person> and the
melancholy <person name="Yarr">Yarr</person>. Afterwards rode across to the Headquarters of the
Royal Naval Division and on to their trenches, some 3-1/2 miles.
<person name="General_Mercer">Generals Mercer</person> and <person name="General_Paris">Paris</person> followed us through their trenches. The <unit type="battalion">Hood</unit>
and <unit type="battalion">Hawke Battalions</unit> were in the firing line where we talked to great
numbers of old comrades of all ranks. Glad to meet <person name="Fredyberg">Freyberg</person> again (the
man who swam to light the flares at Enos). <person name="Kelly">Kelly</person> of the <unit type="battalion">Hood Battalion</unit>
too, I saw, and <person name="Fairfax">Fairfax</person> of the <unit type="battalion">Hawke</unit>, also <person name="Commander_King">Commander King</person> of the <unit type="battalion">Drake
Battalion</unit> and <person name="Burrows">Burrows</person>, a gunner who was running a bombing school with
much zeal on a piece of ground specially patronized by the Turks as a
target for their own shelling practice. Got back to <location country="Greece">Helles</location> by the Saghur
Dere and the Gulley. Going down the Gulley, nearly lost two of our
attendant Generals, a shrapnel bursting between them with a startling
loud report caused by the high banks of the Gulley on either side.</p>

<p>In the Gulley we met a swarm of old friends from <location town="Kent">Kent</location>; <person name="Clifton-Browne">Brigadier-General
Clifton-Browne</person>, an officer whose command I had inspected both at
<location town="Potchefstroom">Potchefstroom</location> and near <location town="Canterbury">Canterbury</location>, with a Brigade of West and East Kent
and Sussex Yeomen. They made a brave showing, but <person name="Clifton-Browne">he</person> tells me some of
  them have caught this wretched enteritis already. Amongst others, I
spoke to <person name="Douglas">Douglas</person>, commanding the <unit type="division">East Lancashire Division</unit>, <person name="Major_Edwards">Major Edwards</person>
of the Sussex Yeomanry, <person name="Sir_S._Scott">Major Sir S. Scott</person> and <person name="Colonel_Whitburn">Colonel Whitburn</person> of the
West Kent Yeomanry, Colonel Lord Guilford, East Kent Yeomanry. A
cheerier crowd no one could wish to meet. If these are the type of men
who spin black yarns for home wear, I can only say that not the most
finished actors could better disguise their despair. <person name="Commander_King">General King</person>, R.A.,
rode part of the way back with us.</p>

<p>After all this hard exercise, got back to the <location ship="H.M.S. Arno">_Arno_</location> in a lather of
sweat about 6 o'clock carrying <person name="Davies">Davies</person> with me. <person name="Leslie_Wilson">Leslie Wilson</person>, commanding
the <unit type="division">Hawke Battalion</unit>, had gone sick to-day, so sent <person name="Leslie_Wilson">him</person> a telegram after
dinner to the Hospital ship _Somali_, telling <person name="Leslie_Wilson">him</person> <person name="Leslie_Wilson">his</person> trenches had been
found in apple-pie order.</p>

<p>_11th October, 1915._ Bad night with this beastly complaint. <person name="John_de_Robeck">De Robeck</person>
came up at 11 o'clock to see me. <person name="John_de_Robeck">He</person> has had a message from the Admiralty
asking him what number of extra troops could be maintained on the
<location peninsula="Gallipoli">Peninsula</location> if the units there now were brought up to strength. The
Admiral asked me for the figures and the A.G. brought them over. My
force as a whole is as near as may be to half strength. Half of that
half are sick men. We have 100,000 men on the Peninsula, 50,000 of whom
are unfit: if the unfits were up to strength there would be 200,000 men
on the Peninsula as well as excitement and movement which would greatly
reduce the disease. Bearing in mind that the Anzacs have been well
supported by their Governments and that their units are fairly strong,
these figures show what wait-and-see-sickness has meant to <location country="England">British</location>
Regiments.</p>

<p>The tone of this Admiralty question had seemed cheerful: almost as if
the Higher Direction were thinking of putting us on our legs but, in
the evening, another cable from <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> gave a different and a very ominous
complexion to the future:--</p>

<p>"From <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Earl Kitchener</person> to General Sir <person name="Ian_Hamilton">Ian Hamilton</person>. What is <person name="Ian_Hamilton">your</person> estimate
of the probable losses which would be entailed to your force if the
evacuation of the <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location> Peninsula was decided on and carried out in
the most careful manner?</p>

<p>"No decision has been arrived at yet on this question of evacuation, but
<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">I</person> feel that <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">I</person> ought to have your views.</p>

<p>"In <person name="Ian_Hamilton">your</person> reply <person name="Ian_Hamilton">you</person> need not consider the possible future danger to the
<location country="England">Empire</location> that might be thus caused."[15]</p>

<p>If they do this they make the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> into the bloodiest tragedy of
the world! Even if we were to escape without a scratch, they would stamp
our enterprise as the bloodiest of all tragedies! <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> has always sworn by
all <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person> Gods <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> would have no hand in it. I won't touch it, and I think
<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> knew that and calculated on that when <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> cabled. Anyway, let <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person>, cat
or Cabinet leap where they will, I must sleep upon my answer, but that
answer will be NO!</p>

<p>Just as I am turning in, a cable from the S. of S. saying, "there is an
idea that Sir John <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person> is not sending you as many troops as <person name="Maxwell">he</person> might
from <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>. Have you any complaints on this score?" Rather late in the
day this "idea." Certainly, I have never made any "complaints" and I
don't mean to do so now. The War Office have only to look up their
returns and see how many men are being maintained to defend us from the
Senoussi!</p>

<p><person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person> has never had less than 70,000 troops in <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>, a country which
might have been held with 10,000 rifles--ever since we landed here, that
is to say. My troops can sail back to <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> very much faster than the
Turks--or the Senoussi for that matter--can march to the Canal.</p>

<p>In the same cable the S. of S. asks what is the cause of the sick rate
and remarks that, "some accounts from the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> indicate that the
men are dispirited." Small wonder if they were! When they see two
Divisions taken away from the <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Peninsula</location>; when their guns can't answer
those of the enemy; when each unit finds itself half-strength, and
falling--why then, tumbling as they do to the fact that we won't get
through till next year, they _ought_ to be unhappy. But the funny thing
is that the Cabinet, the Secretaries of State, are the people who are
"dispirited" and _not_ the people out here. If the P.M. could walk round
the trenches of the Naval Division at <location country="Greece">Helles</location>, or if <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> could exchange
greetings with the rank and file at <location bay="Anzac">Anzac</location> and <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location>, they would find a
sovereign antidote for the blues and would realize that it was they who
were down-hearted and _not_ the men at the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location>. There was an
old French Colonel, killed at Gravelotte; he had studied the classic
world battles and he shows that it was never the front line who gave way
first, but always the reserves:--they, the reserves, watched bloodshed
in cold blood until they could stand it no longer and so took to their
heels whilst the fighting men were still focussed upon victory. Not the
enemy in front but the friends behind are the men who spread despondency
and alarm.</p>

<p><person name="Charley_Burn">Charley Burn</person> has arrived on the <location ship="H.M.S. Imogene">_Imogene_</location> with <person name="Dawnay">Dawnay</person>.</p>

<p><person name="Davies">Davies</person> went back to <location country="Greece">Helles</location> after tea. <person name="Dawnay">Dawnay</person> says <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> was most interested
in <person name="Dawnay">him</person> and most charming to <person name="Dawnay">him</person> all through <person name="Dawnay">his</person> stay until <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person> last
interview just before <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> started on <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person> return journey. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person>'s manner
then, <person name="Dawnay">he</person> said, had changed--so much so as to give <person name="Dawnay">him</person> an impression that
the great man was turning, or was being turned, against all of us out
here. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person>'s conduct at the first meetings is in full harmony with <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person>
message sent to <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person> for me by <person name="Fitz">Fitz</person> about a fortnight ago, saying
I possessed <person name="Fitz">his</person> fullest confidence. The change of manner was marked and
<person name="Dawnay">Dawnay</person> is sure <person name="Dawnay">he</person> made no mistake about it. But nothing has happened
since the date of <person name="Dawnay">Dawnay</person>'s arrival and departure save a very well
engineered withdrawal of the <unit type="division">10th</unit> and the French Divisions for which, in
point of fact, we have all been rather expecting congratulations. <person name="Dawnay">Dawnay</person>
thinks some queer things are happening. <person name="Dawnay">He</person> could--or would--say nothing
more.</p>

<entry>
<p>_12th October, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ Early in the morning got off my answer to
<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person>'s evacuation cable. The elements, the enemy and ourselves are the
three factors of the problem. Were I to measure my problem by the night
flitting of the <location country="Irish">Irish</location> and French Divisions (who lost neither man nor
beast in the process), I could guarantee that we would shoot the moon
with the balance of the force smoothly, swiftly and silently. That is to
say, supposing the Turks and the weather remain constant. But these are
two most inconstant things: no one can tell how a Turk will behave under
any given conditions; the Turks themselves do not know how they will
behave: the weather now is written down by the meteorologists for sudden
changes; for storms. Unsettled weather is due and ought to be reckoned
upon. Imagine a blow coming up from the South when the evacuation is
half way through. That does not seem to be, and is not, any great
stretch of imagination. Well then, having so imagined, we get a disaster
only equalled in history by that of the <location city="Athens">Athenians</location> at <location city="Syracuse">Syracuse</location>: a
disaster from which the <location country="England">British Empire</location> could hardly hope to recover.</p>

<p>Twice backwards and forwards to the General Staff Marquee with the draft
of my guesses, my first being that we would probably lose 35 to 45 per
cent. But the General Staff have also been consulting their oracle and
were clear for 50 per cent. Months of the most anxious calculations will
not get a white man one whit forrarder in seeing into the brains of an
Asiatic Army or in forecasting Mediterranean weather. Safest to assume
that both brains and weather will behave as the German General Staff
would wish them to behave rather than as they chanced to behave when the
French and <location country="Ireland">Irish</location> went off a few days ago. So have ended by taking the
Staff's figure because any figure being, in any case, the wildest of
shots, their shot best suits my views on the issue.</p>

<p>"From General Sir <person name="Ian_Hamilton">Ian Hamilton</person> to <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Earl Kitchener</person>. Our losses would
depend on such uncertain factors, enemy's action or inaction, weather,
question whether we could rely on all troops covering embarkation to
fight to the last, that impossible to give you straight answer
especially until I have permission to consult Admiral. Once discussing
this very problem with General <person name="Gouraud">Gouraud</person>, we came to the conclusion that
at Cape <location country="Greece">Helles</location> we must sacrifice two divisions out of total of six
divisions and Cape <location country="Greece">Helles</location> easiest of three places to get away from. My
opinion now is that it would not be wise to reckon on getting out of
<location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location> with less loss than that of half the total force as well as
guns, which must be used to the last, stores, railway plant and horses.
Moral of those who got off would fall very low. One quarter would
probably get off quite easily, then the trouble would begin. We might be
very lucky and lose considerably less than I have estimated. On the
other hand, with all these raw troops at <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> and all these Senegalese
at Cape <location country="Greece">Helles</location>, we might have a veritable catastrophe."</p>

<p>Do the men toying with the idea of bringing off our men not see that
thereby the Turks will be let loose somewhere; not nowhere? Do they not
see that if they are feeling the economic pinch of keeping their side of
the show in being, the Turks, much weaker economically, must be feeling
it much more--!</p>



<p>It was a relief to get this perilous stuff off my chest, and in a
brighter frame of mind, sailed for <location bay="Anzac">Anzac</location> on the destroyer <location ship="H.M.S. Lewis">_Lewis_.</location> We
took biscuits and bully beef with us but the hospitable sailors insisted
on regaling us with a hot meal. Sat in cabin all the way as usual
writing up my record. <person name="Freddie">Freddie</person> tells me that these studious habits of
mine have started the shave that I spend my time composing poetry,
especially during our battles!</p>

<p>At <location bay="Anzac">Anzac</location> <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdwood</person> took us round the trenches and underground passages
about <person name="Russell">Russell</person>'s Top and Turk's Head, held by the <unit type="division">5th Brigade</unit>, <unit type="division">2nd</unit>
Division, under <person name="Legge">Legge</person>. Half way up to <person name="Russell">Russell</person>'s Top was the 3rd Battery
<location country="Australia">Australia</location> Field Artillery:--talked with Major King, the C.O. Next unit
was the <unit type="battalion">20th Infantry Battalion</unit> under <person name="Major_Fitzgerald">Major Fitzgerald.</person> <person name="Colonel_Holmes">Colonel Holmes,</person>
commanding the <unit type="brigade">5th Infantry Brigade,</unit> and <person name="Wilson">Wilson</person>, <person name="Wilson">his</person> Brigade Major, took
us through their cave dwellings. Ex-westerners say that in <location country="France">France</location> they
have nothing to touch these <location country="Australia">Australia</location> tunnellings. In one place they
are boring into a crater only 20 feet from the <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> trench. There is
nothing unusual in the fact, but there is in the great depth they are
going down so as to cross the danger zone far below the beaten track of
mines and counter-mines. On the steep slope in another place there is a
complete underground trench running parallel to, and only a short
bomb-throw from, a <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> trench. We went through it with a lantern.
Sandbags, loopholes, etc., all are there, but blind! They are still
veiled from view by several feet of clay. To-morrow night the Anzacs are
going to chip off the whole upper crust of earth, and when light dawns
the Turks will find a well equipped trench, every loophole manned,
within bombing range of their own line.</p>

<p>Other notables met with were <person name="Major_Murphy">Major Murphy</person> of the <unit type="battalion">20th Infantry
Battalion</unit>, <person name="Major_Anderson">Major Anderson</person> (an old friend) commanding the <location country="Australia">Australia</location>
Field Artillery, and <person name="Cpt.Perry_Oakdene">Captain Perry Oakdene</person>, the Engineer Officer on the
job. Saw <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdie</person> and returned in the destroyer about 6.30. The day had
been so quiet that it would have been almost dull had it not been for
the sightseeing--hardly a shot was fired by Turk or Anzac with either
gun, trench mortar or rifle.</p>

<p><person name="Bishop_Price">Bishop Price</person>, the Bishop of North China, and <person name="Charlie_Burn">Charlie Burn</person>, King's
Messenger, dined. The quietness of the Bishop was remarkable.</p>

<p>Have cabled the S. of S. for War in answer to his enquiries about the
  causes of the sickness, and as to whether <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person> is not holding up my
share of troops in <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>, saying:--(1) that "constant strain and
infection by dust and flies" have caused the sickness but that the men
are getting better; (2) that "we have been under the impression that
drafts meant for us and due to us have been retained in <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>; also,
that men discharged fit from Hospitals have been held back, but I have
represented this last point to <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person> personally as I always feel I am
not the person to gauge <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person>'s needs. On 27th September, I asked him
to send up all available <location country="Australia">Australia</location>--<location country="New Zealand">New Zealand</location> Army Corps drafts and
reinforcements, and, as you already know, am at present in telegraphic
correspondence about these reinforcements coming straight here without
being kept in <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> for training at all."</p>

<p>At 10.40, after clearing my table, went with <person name="Ellison">Ellison</person>, <person name="Taylor">Taylor</person>, and
<person name="Freddie">Freddie</person> on board <location ship="H.M.S. Lefroy">H.M.S. _Lefroy_</location> (Commander Edwards) and steamed for "V"
Beach. Enjoyed a fine luncheon with <person name="Brulard">Brulard</person> and then started off for the
trenches. At <location bay="Morto Bay">Morto Bay</location> we were met by <person name="Cpt.de_Bourbon">Captain de Bourbon</person>, a big handsome
man with the characteristic <person name="Cpt.de_Bourbon">Bourbon</person> cut of countenance. <person name="Cpt.de_Bourbon">He</person> took us first
to the _château_ whence we worked down along the trenches to where our
extreme right overlooks the Kerevez Dere. <person name="General_Faukard">General Faukard</person> was here and
<person name="General_Faukard">he</person> thinks that we ought easily to get complete mastery of both sides of
the Kerevez Dere as soon as we get the means and the permission to shove
ahead again. When we do that the advance will let our Fleet another half
mile up the Straits and the "spotting" for the ships' guns will double
their value in the Narrows. From the Kerevez Dere we worked along the
fire trenches towards the French centre and then, getting to a sheltered
strip of country, walked back across the open to the second line. From
the second line we made our way, still across the open, to the third
line, over a heather covered strip. No one ever moves here by daylight
except in double quick time as there is always danger of drawing a shell
either from Asia or from <location heights="Achi Baba">Achi Baba</location> and so it was that "Let the dead
bury the dead" had been the motto and that we met many corpses and
skeletons. Merciful God, what home tragedies may centre in each of these
sinister bundles. But it is the common lot--only quicker. Here, too, we
found excavations made by the French into a burial ground believed to be
of the date 2,500 B.C. The people of that golden age had the sentimental
idea of being buried in couples in big jars. A strange notion of our
Allies unburying quiet people who had enjoyed dreamless rest for 2,000
years whilst, within a few yards, their own dead still welter in the
parching wind.</p>

<p>[Illustration: CREMATING THE ENEMY DEAD _"Central News" phot._]</p>

<p>Had meant to run across and see <person name="Davies">Davies</person> but time had slipped away and so
we made tracks for <location ship="H.M.S. LeFroy">H.M.S. _Lefroy_</location>, and on back here to G.H.Q., where a
letter from <person name="Callwell">Callwell</person> was laying in wait as a refresher after my
fatigues.</p>

<p><person name="Callwell">Callwell</person> begins by saying <person name="Callwell">he</person> encloses a document written by my late
visitor, Mr. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> A. <person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person>, although "there are certain statements in
this which are palpably false," and although <person name="Dawnay">Dawnay</person> has pointed out to
him at the War Office "a number of passages in it which are wholly
incorrect as matters of actual fact." <person name="Callwell">He</person> says, <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person>, "who has not had
ime to read it yet," thinks I ought to be given a chance of defending
myself.</p>

<p><person name="Callwell">Callwell</person> goes on to write about the Press Censorship and my plea for
publicity and then says <person name="Callwell">he</person> dislikes the <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> stunt "because I am not
quite clear of where we are going to, and the immediate result at the
present is to take away from you troops that you can ill spare." Also,
because "we may be involving ourselves in operations on a great scale in
the heart of the Balkans, the result of which it is very difficult to
foresee."</p>

<p><person name="Godley">Godley</person> dined. <person name="Cpt.Davidson">Captain Davidson</person>, R.N., the Senior Naval Officer in
harbour now, is a real Godsend. He looks after us as if we were Admirals
of the Fleet.</p>

<p>Have now read, marked, learnt and inwardly indigested <person name="Callwell">Callwell</person>'s
enclosure; viz., the letter written by Mr. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> A. <person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person> to the Prime
Minister of <location country="Australia">Australia</location>. Quite a Guy Fawkes epistle. <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person> is "more
cordially detested in our forces than <person name="Enver_Pasha">Enver Pasha</person>." "You will trust me
when I  say that the work of the General Staff in <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location> is
deplorable." "Sedition is talked round every tin of bully beef on the
Peninsula." "You would refuse to believe that these men were really
<location country="England">British</location> soldiers ... the <location country="England">British</location> physique is very much below that of the
Turks. Indeed, it is quite obviously so. Our men have found it
impossible to form a high opinion of the <location country="England">British</location> <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> men and
Territorials. They are merely a lot of childlike youths, without
strength to endure or brains to improve their conditions." "I shall
always remember the stricken face of a young English Lieutenant when I
told him he must make up his mind for a winter campaign." "I do not like
to dictate this sentence, even for your eyes, but the fact is that after
the first day at <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> an order had to be issued to Officers to shoot
without mercy any soldier who lagged behind or loitered in an advance."</p>

<p>Well, Well! I should not worry myself over the out-pourings of our late
guest, who has evidently been made a tool of by some unscrupulous
person, were it not that <person name="Mr.Asquith">Mr.Asquith</person> has clothed the said out-pourings
in the title, number, garb and colour of a verified and authentic State
paper. <person name="Mr.Asquith">He</person> has actually had them printed on the famous duck's egg
foolscap of the Committee of Imperial Defence, and under <person name="Mr.Asquith">his</person> authority,
as President and Prime Minister, they have been circulated round the
Government and all the notables of the Empire without any chance having
been offered to me (or to <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person>) of defending the honour of <location country="England">British</location>
Officers or the good name of the <location country="England">British</location> Rank and File. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> tells
<person name="Callwell">Callwell</person> I should be given the opportunity of making a reply. Not having
read it himself <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> has not yet grasped the fact that <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> also should have
been given the opportunity of making a reply to the aspersions upon <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person>
selections. As for me, by the time my answer can get home and can be
printed and circulated the slanders will have had over a month's start
in <location country="England">England</location> and very likely two months' start in <location country="Australia">Australia</location>, where all who
read them will naturally conclude their statements must have been tested
before ever they were published in that impressive form.</p>

<p>Here we see an irresponsible statement by an ignorant man and I
instinctively feel as if it were being used as one more weapon to force
<person name="Mr.Asquith">Asquith's</person> hand and to ruin our last chance. I only hope it may not prove
another case of, "Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!"</p>

<p>Certain aspects of this affair trouble my understanding. The covering
note (dated 25th September) which encloses the letter to the Prime
Minister of <location country="Australia">Australia</location> (dated 23rd September) is addressed by Mr.<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person>
to <person name="Mr.Asquith">Mr.Asquith</person> by name. In that covering note Mr.<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person> says, "I write
with diffidence, and only at Mr. <person name="David_Lloyd_George">Lloyd George</person>'s request." Within three
days (so great the urgency or pressure) <person name="Mr.Asquith">Mr.Asquith</person> causes--as <person name="Mr.Asquith">he</person>,
President of the Committee of Imperial Defence, alone can cause--the
covering note as well as the seven or eight thousand words of the letter
to be printed and circulated round the big wigs of Politics, as well as
(to judge by the co-incident hardening of the tone of this mail's
papers) some of the Editors. Not one word to me as to Mr.<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person>'s
qualifications or as to the truth or falsity of <person name="Murdoch">his</person> statements, until
these last have been a week in circulation. Then, I receive; first, a
cable saying unofficial reports had come in censuring my General Staff
and that I had better, therefore, let <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person> go; secondly, a cable
asking me whether the absurd story of my having ordered my own soldiers
to be shot "without mercy " is well-founded; thirdly, a bad last, the
libellous letter itself.</p>

<p>Yet <person name="Mr.Asquith">Mr.Asquith</person> did know the paper contained _some_ falsehoods. <person name="Mr.Asquith">He</person> _may_
have attached weight to Mr.<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person>'s tale of the feelings of French
soldiers at <location country="Greece">Helles</location> (although <person name="Murdoch">he</person> never found time to go there): <person name="Mr.Asquith">he</person> _may_
have believed Mr.<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person> when <person name="Murdoch">he</person> says that Sir John <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person> "has a poor
brain for <person name="Maxwell">his</person> big position"; that "our men feel that their reputation is
too sacred to leave in the hands of <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person>"; that <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Sir William Birdwood</person>
"has not the fighting quality or big brain of a great General"; that
<person name="General_Spens">General Spens</person> was "a man broken on the Continent" (although <person name="General_Spens">he</person> never was
broken and never served on the Continent); that "<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Kitchener</person> has a
terrible task in getting pure work from the General Staff of the <location country="England">British</location>
Army, whose motives can never be pure, for they are unchangeably
selfish"; that "from what I saw of the Turk, I am convinced he is ... a
better man than those opposed to him" (although, actually, Mr.<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person>
saw nothing of the Turks). The P.M. may have taken these views at their
face values: even, <person name="Mr.Asquith">he</person> _may_ have swallowed Mr.<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person>'s picture of the
conscientious <person name="Altham">Altham</person> "wallowing" in ice whilst wounded were expiring of
heat within a few hundred yards; but _<person name="Mr.Asquith">Mr.Asquith</person> has seen the <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> Army_
and, therefore, _he cannot have believed_ that these soldiers have
suddenly been transformed into "merely a lot of childish youths without
strength to endure or brains to improve their conditions."</p>

<p>Once more; these reckless scraps of hearsay would not be worth the paper
they are printed on were it not that they are endorsed with the letters
C.I.D., the stamp of the ministerial Holy of Holies. Only the Prime
Minister himself, personally, can so consign a paper. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> and I were
both members of the C.I.D., and members of long standing. For the
President to circularize our fellow members behind our backs with
unverified accusations is a strange act, foreign to all my ideas of <person name="Mr.Asquith">Mr.
Asquith.</person> On this point <person name="Callwell">Callwell</person> is quite clear: the <person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person> letter was
published to the C.I.D. on the 28th ult. and <person name="Callwell">Callwell</person> writes on the 2nd
inst., and says <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> "has not had time to read it yet."[16] But
nothing else is clear. In fact, the whole thing is foreign to all my
ideas of <person name="Mr.Asquith">Mr.Asquith</person>. <person name="Mr.Asquith">He</person> does not need to work the C.I.D. oracle in this
way. As P.M. <person name="Mr.Asquith">he</person> has only to speak the word. <person name="Mr.Asquith">He</person> does not work the Press
oracle either: not <person name="Mr.Asquith">his</person> custom: also <person name="Mr.Asquith">he</person> likes <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> The whole thing is a
mystery, of which I can only say with Hamlet--"miching mallecho; it
means mischief."</p>

<p>_14th October, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ Colder than ever. We are told that the

<p>Being Mail day as well as rough, stuck to camp. My friend <location country="England">England</location> sailed
into harbour in the <location ship="H.M.S. Chelmer">_Chelmer_</location> and came up to lunch. In the evening he

liaison officer with the French in place of de Putron who has gone to
<location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> with <person name="Bailloud">Bailloud</person>.</p>

<p>As to the <person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person> unpleasantness, I began an _exposé_ to be sent to the
Governor General of <location country="Australia">Australia</location>; another to the Secretary of the C.I.D.
But <person name="Cpt.Pollen">Pollen</person>, <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person> and <person name="Dawnay">Dawnay</person> (the last of whom had been shown the
document whilst <person name="Dawnay">he</person> was at home, though <person name="Dawnay">he</person> had said nothing to me about
it) thought this was to make much ado about nothing. They cannot believe
<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> will trouble himself about the matter any further and they think
it best handled in lighter vein. Is <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> still the demi-God, that is the
question? Anyway, there is simply no time this Mail to deal with so many
misstatements, so that has settled it.</p>

                          "MEDTN. EXPEDITIONARY FORCE,
                                 _"14th October, 1915._</p>

<p>  "DEAR CALLWELL,</p>

<p>"I have read Mr.<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person>'s letter with care, and I have tried to give it
my most impartial consideration and not to allow myself in reply to be
influenced in any way by the criticisms <person name="Murdoch">he</person> may have felt himself bound
to make upon myself personally.</p>

<p>"What does this letter amount to? Here we have a man, a journalist by
profession, one who is quick to seize every point, and to coin epithets,
which throw each fleeting impression into strongest relief. <person name="Murdoch">He</person> comes
armed with a natural and justifiably enthusiastic admiration for
everything connected with the Commonwealth to which <person name="Murdoch">he</person> belongs, and
ready to retail to <person name="Murdoch">his</person> Minister or <person name="Murdoch">his</person> public anything that can
contribute to show the troops they have sent in an heroic light.</p>

<p>"Here <person name="Murdoch">he</person> obtains <person name="Murdoch">his</person> first sight of war and of the horrors and hardships
inseparable from it. <person name="Murdoch">He</person> finds men who have just been through some of
the hardest fighting imaginable and who have suffered terrible losses;
<person name="Murdoch">he</person> finds probably that very many of those whom <person name="Murdoch">he</person> hoped to see,
certainly many of those of whose welfare their motherland would wish to
hear, are killed, wounded or laid up with illness,--<person name="Murdoch">he</person> finds all this
and <person name="Murdoch">he</person> becomes very deeply depressed. In such an atmosphere Mr.<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person>
composes <person name="Murdoch">his</person> letter, a general analysis of which shows it to be divided,
to <person name="Murdoch">my</person> mind, into two separate strata.</p>

<p>"First an appreciation in burning terms of the spirit, the achievements,
the physique and all soldierly qualities of the <location country="Australia">Australia</location> Forces.
Secondly, a condemnation, as sweeping and as unrelieved as <person name="Murdoch">his</person> praise in
the first instance is unstinted, of the whole of the rest of the force.
I myself as C.-in-C., my Generals, my Staff, Lines of Communication, Sir
John <person name="Maxwell">Maxwell</person> and <person name="General_Spens">General Spens</person> at the Base, even the <location country="England">British</location> soldiers
collectively and individually, are all embraced in this condemnation
which is completed by the inclusion of the entire direction of the
Forces at home, both Naval and Military.</p>

<p>"Where all are thus tarred with the same brush, I am content to leave it
to the impartial reader to decide what reliance can be placed on Mr.
<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person>'s judgment. My own feeling certainly is that in <person name="Murdoch">his</person> admiration
for the <location country="Australia">Australia</location> Forces, and in <person name="Murdoch">his</person> grief at their heavy losses (in
both of which feelings I fully share) <person name="Murdoch">he</person> has allowed himself to belittle
and to criticize us all so that their virtues might be thrown into even
bolder relief.</p>

<p>"With Mr.<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person>'s detailed points I do not propose to deal, nor do I
think you expect me to do so. On every page inaccuracies of fact abound.
The breaking of Spens on the Continent, a theatre of war <person name="Murdoch">he</person> has never
visited; the over-statement of our casualties by more than 40 per cent.;
the acceptance as genuine of a wholly mythical order about the shooting
of laggards--really the task would be too long. As to the value of Mr.
<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person>'s appreciation of the strategical and tactical elements of the
situation you can yourself assess them at their true value.</p>

<p>"Finally, I do not for one moment believe the general statement put
forward to the effect that the troops are disheartened. Neither that
statement nor the assertion that they are discontented with the <location country="England">British</location>
Officers commanding them has the slightest foundation in fact.</p>

  <p>                              "Believe me,
                                 "My dear <person name="Callwell">Callwell</person>,
                              "Yours very sincerely,
                                   (_Sd._) "IAN HAMILTON.</p>

<p>"P.S.--I attach correspondence showing how Mr.<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person>'s visit arose. I
believe I exceeded my power in giving <person name="Murdoch">him</person> permission to come but I was
most anxious to oblige the <location country="Australia">Australia</location> Prime Minister and Senator Pearce.
You will see that <person name="Murdoch">he</person> promises faithfully to observe any conditions I may
impose. The only condition I imposed was that <person name="Murdoch">he</person> should sign a
declaration identical with that which I attach. <person name="Murdoch">He</person> signed and the paper
is in my possession."</p>


<p>CORRESPONDENCE.</p>


<p>"Dear Sir,</p>

<p>"On the advice of Brigadier-General <person name="Legge">Legge</person> <person name="Murdoch">I</person> beg to request permission to
visit <location bay="Anzac">Anzac.</location></p>

<p>"I am proceeding from <location town="Melbourne">Melbourne</location> to <location city="London">London</location> to take up the position of
managing editor of the <location country="Australia">Australia</location> news cable service in connection with
the _London Times_ and at the Commonwealth Government's request am
enquiring into mail arrangements, dispositions of wounded, and various
matters in <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> in connection with our <location country="Australia">Australia</location> Forces. <person name="Murdoch">I</person> find it
impossible to make a complete report upon changes that have been
suggested here until <person name="Murdoch">I</person> have a better knowledge of the system pursued at
base Y, and on the Mainland, and <person name="Murdoch">I</person> beg of you, therefore, to permit <person name="Murdoch">me</person>
to visit these places.</p>

<p>"<person name="Murdoch">I</person> should like to go across in only a semi-official capacity, so that <person name="Murdoch">I</person>
might record censored impressions in the London and <location country="Australia">Australia</location>
newspapers <person name="Murdoch">I</person> represent, but any conditions <person name="Ian_Hamilton">you</person> impose <person name="Murdoch">I</person> should, of
course, faithfully observe.</p>

<p>"<person name="Murdoch">I</person> beg to enclose (_a_) copy of general letter from the Prime Minister
and (_b_) copy of <person name="Murdoch">my</person> instructions from the Government. <person name="Murdoch">I</person> have a personal
letter of introduction to you from <person name="Senator_Pearce">Senator Pearce</person>, Minister of Defence.</p>

<p>"May <person name="Murdoch">I</person> add that <person name="Murdoch">I</person> had the honour of meeting you at the <location town="Melbourne">Melbourne</location> Town
Hall, and wrote fully of your visit in the <location town="Sydney">Sydney</location> _Sun_ and <location town="Melbourne">Melbourne</location>
_Punch_; also may <person name="Murdoch">I</person> say that my anxiety as an <location country="Australia">Australia</location> to visit the
sacred shores of <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location> while our army is there is intense.</p>

<p>"<person name="Senator_Millen">Senator Millen</person> asked <person name="Murdoch">me</person> to convey <person name="Senator_Millen">his</person> most kindly remembrances to you
if <person name="Murdoch">I</person> had the luck to see you and in case <person name="Murdoch">I</person> have not <person name="Murdoch">I</person> take this
opportunity of doing so.</p>

<p>"As <person name="Murdoch">I</person> have only four weeks in which to complete <person name="Murdoch">my</person> work here and get to
London a 'collect reply by cable to C/o Colonel Sellheim, <location country="Australia">Australia</location>

<p>When I got this, I hesitated. Evidently the writer was not accredited as
a war correspondent and <person name="Murdoch">his</person> remark about having written <person name="Murdoch">me</person> up in the
 _Sun_ and in _Punch_ did not count for much. But I was anxious then, as
ever, that as many journalists as possible should be put into a position
for seeing the fine things the troops had done and were doing; I noted
the emphasis laid by the writer upon <person name="Murdoch">his</person> acceptance of the censorship,
and so I took upon myself to exceed my powers and asked <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person> to
cable to Mr.<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person>:--</p>



<p>"This cable is your authority to come to G.H.Q. at once whence you will
be sent to <location bay="Anzac">Anzac</location>.</p>

<p>Mr.<person name="Murdoch">Murdoch</person> landed on the 2nd instant and on that date signed the
following declaration:--</p>



<p>DECLARATION TO BE USED BY WAR CORRESPONDENTS.</p>

<p>I, the undersigned, do hereby solemnly undertake to follow in every
particular the rules issued by the Commander-in-Chief through the Chief
Field Censor, relative to correspondence concerning the forces in the
Field, and bind myself not to attempt to correspond by any other route
or by any other means than that officially sanctioned.</p>

<p>Further, in the event of my ceasing to act as correspondent with the
<location country="England">British</location> Forces, I will not during the continuance of the War join the
forces of any other Power in any capacity, or impart to anyone military
information of a confidential nature or of a kind such that its
disclosure is likely to prejudice military operations, which may have
been acquired by me while with the <location country="England">British</location> Forces in the Field, or
publish any writing, plan, map, sketch, photograph or other picture on
military subjects, the material for which has been acquired by me in a
similar manner, unless first submitted by me to the Chief Field Censor
for censorship and passed for publication by him.</p>

<p>_15th October, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ Bitter cold. The whole camp upside down
and all the Staff busy with their shift of quarters to the other side of
the Bay.</p>

<p><person name="Altham">Altham</person> has been at <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> and came over to report how things were
going there. Remembering the accusation of "wallowing" in ice, I nearly
touched him for a Vanilla cream.</p>

  <p>As to <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location>, <person name="Altham">he</person> tells me that, so far, the occupation has been a
travesty of any military operation. No plan; no administration; much
confusion; troops immobile and likely to sit for weeks upon the beach.
The Balkan States Intelligence Officers are on the spot and grasp the
inferences. Until the troops landed they were not quite sure whether
some serious factor was not about to be sprung upon them: now they are
quite sure nothing can happen, big or small, beyond our letting a lot of
our bayonets go rusty. <person name="Sarrail">Sarrail</person> has been implored by the Serbians to push
<person name="Sarrail">his</person> troops up into their country, but <person name="Sarrail">he</person> has been wise enough to
refuse. How can <person name="Sarrail">he</person> feed them? On the top of it all, the conduct of the
Greeks seems fishy. As to the Bulgarians, they have already thrown off
the mask. Although <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> is going to be our ruin, I can still spare
some pity for <person name="Sarrail">Sarrail</person>.</p>

<p>Have heard from <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdie</person> who at last gives me leave to see <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">his</person> Lone Pine
section. Until now I have never been able to get him to let me go there.
Too many bombs, <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">he</person> says, to make it quite healthy for a
Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>_16th October, 1915. <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>._ Had just got into bed last night when I
was ferreted out again by a cable "Secret and personal" from <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> telling
me to decipher the next message myself. The messenger brought a note
from the G.S.--most of whom have now gone across to the other side of
the Bay--to ask if I would like to be awakened when the second message
came in. As I knew the contents as well as if I had written it out
myself, I said no, that it was to be brought me with the cipher book at
my usual hour for being called in the morning. When I had given this
order, my mind dwelt awhile over my sins. Through my tired brain passed
thought-pictures of philosophers waiting for cups of hemlock and various
other strange and half-forgotten antique images. Then I fell asleep.</p>

<p>Next morning, <person name="Cpt.Pollen">Peter Pollen</person> came in with the cipher book and the
bow-string. I got <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person>'s message pat in my dreams last night and here it
is, to a word, in black and white:--</p>



<p>"The War Council held last night decided that though the Government
fully appreciate your work and the gallant manner in which you
personally have struggled to make the enterprise a success in face of
the terrible difficulties you have had to contend against, they, all the
same, wish to make a change in the command which will give them an
opportunity of seeing you."</p>

<p>How far we have travelled, in spirit, since <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> sent me <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person> September
greetings with spontaneous assurances of complete confidence! Yet, since
then, on the ground, I have not travelled at all--have indeed been under
the order of the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> Committee to stand still.</p>

<p><person name="Charles_Munro">Charles Munro</person> is to relieve me and brings with him a Chief of Staff who
will take <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person>'s place. On my way back I "might visit <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location>
and <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>" so as to be able to give the Cabinet the latest about the
hang of things in these places.</p>

<p>When I go, <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdie</person> is to take my place pending <person name="Charles_Munro">Munro</person>'s arrival.</p>

<p><person name="John_de_Robeck">De Robeck</person> must give me a cruiser so that we may start for home
to-morrow. The offer of a jaunt at Government expense to <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> and
<location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> leaves me cold. They think nothing of spending some hundreds of
pounds to put off an awkward moment. What value on earth could my views
on <location city="Salonika">Salonika</location> and <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> possess for people who have no use for my views on
my own subject!</p>

<p>After breakfast, read <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person>'s cable over once more. "A War Council," it
seems, decided to make the change. Did the War Council also appoint
<person name="Charles_Munro">Munro</person>? <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> did not appoint him--anyway. <person name="Charles_Munro">Munro</person> succeeded me at <location town="Hythe">Hythe.</location> In
1897 I was brought home from <location town="Tirah">Tirah</location> to <location town="Hythe">Hythe</location> by <person name="Evelyn_Wood">Evelyn Wood</person> in order that
I might keep an eye on the original ideas which, from <location country="India">India</location> under <person name="Lord_Roberts">Lord
Roberts</person>, had revolutionized the whole system of <location country="England">British</location> musketry. I left
<location town="Hythe">Hythe</location> on the outbreak of the <location country="South Africa">South Africa</location>n War and during that war <person name="Charles_Munro">Munro</person>
went there.</p>

<p><person name="Charles_Munro">He</person> was born with another sort of mind from me. Had <person name="Charles_Munro">he</person> been sent out here
in the first instance <person name="Charles_Munro">he</person> would never have touched the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location>, and
people who have realized so much may conclude <person name="Charles_Munro">he</person> will now clear out. But
it does not follow. <person name="Charles_Munro">Munro</person>'s refusal to attempt a landing in the first
instance would have served as the foundation stone for some totally
different policy in the Near East. That might perhaps have been a good
plan. But to start a campaign with me and try to carry it on with <person name="Charles_Munro">Munro</person>
has already been tried and found hardly fair to either of us. The
intention of whoever selected <person name="Charles_Munro">Munro</person> is so to use him as to force <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> to
pull down the blinds. But they may be mistaken in <person name="Charles_Munro">his</person> character.</p>

<p>One thing is sure: whenever I get home I shall do what I can to convince
<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> that the game is still in <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person> hands if only <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> will shake himself
free from slippery politics; come right out here and run the show
himself. <location town="Constantinople">Constantinople</location> is the only big big hit lying open on the map at
this moment. With the reinforcements and munitions <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person>, as
Commander-in-Chief, would have at <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person> command, <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">he</person> can bring off the coup
right away. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">He</person> has only to borrow a suitable number of howitzers and
aeroplanes from the Western front and our troops begin to advance.
<person name="Sarrail">Sarrail</person> has missed the chance of twenty generations by not coming here.
Let <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> step in. In the whole of the Near East <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">his</person> name alone is still
worth an Army Corps. My own chance has gone. That is no reason why my
old Chief should not himself make good. I told the War Council we held
at <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> before the battle of the 21st August that if the Government
persisted in refusing me drafts and munitions--if they insisted on
leaving my units at half-strength--then they would have to get someone
cleverer than myself to carry out the job. Well, it has come to that
now. <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> looms big in the public eye and can insist on not being starved.
<person name="Herbert_Kitchener">He</person> must hurry up though! Time enough has been lost, God knows. But even
to-day there is time. Howitzers, trench mortars, munitions, men, on a
scale <location country="France">France</location> would hardly miss,--the Asiatic side of the Straits would
be occupied--and, in one month from to-day, our warships will have
<location town="Constantinople">Constantinople</location> under their guns. If <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord K.</person> won't listen to me, then, having
been officially mis-informed that the War Council wish to see me (the
last thing they _do_ wish), I will take them at their word. I will
buttonhole every Minister from <person name="McKenna">McKenna</person> and <person name="David_Lloyd_George">Lloyd George</person> to Asquith and
Bonar Law,--and grovel at their feet if by doing so I can hold them on
to this, the biggest scoop that is, or ever has been, open to an
Empire.</p>

<p>Rather a sickly lunch. Not so much the news as the Benger's on which we
all feasted for our stomach's sake. <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdie</person> came over at 4 p.m. with
<person name="Ruthven">Ruthven</person>. Both <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">his</person> A.D.C.s are sick. I am going to ask him to take on
young <person name="Alec_McGrigor">Alec McGrigor</person>. <person name="Peter">Peter</person> and <person name="Freddie">Freddie</person> will come home with <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person>
and myself. What a true saying,--a friend in need is a friend indeed.
Were I handing over to <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdie</person> for good I should feel unalloyed happiness
in <person name="Cpt.Birdwood">his</person> well-deserved success.</p>

<p>At tea <person name="Ellison">Ellison</person>, <person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person>, <person name="Bertier">Bertier</person>, <person name="Sykes">Colonel Sykes</person> and <person name="Guest">Guest</person> appeared.
They looked more depressed than I felt. I had to work like a beaver
before I could brighten them up. "I'm not dead yet," I felt inclined to
tell them, "no, not by long chalks." What I did say to one or two of
them was this:--"My credit with Government is exhausted; clearly I can't
screw men or munitions out of them. The new Commander will start fresh
with a good balance of faith, hope and charity lodged in the Bank of
<location country="England">England</location>. He comes with a splendid reputation, and if he is big enough to
draw boldly on this deposit, the Army will march; the Fleet will steam
ahead; what has been done will bear fruit, and all our past struggles
and sacrifices will live."</p>

<p>Dined with <person name="Freddie">Freddie</person> on the _<location ship="H.M.S. Triad">Triad</location>_. De Robeck and <person name="Roger_Keyes">Keyes</person> were all that
friends can be at such a moment.</p>

<p>_17th October, 1915. H.M.S. "Chatham"_ (_At sea_). A pretty beastly day
within and without. For the within part, all sorts of good-byes to put
pain into our hearts; for the without, a cold drizzle chilling us all to
the bone.</p>

<p>At 10.30 <person name="Brulard">Brulard</person> and <person name="Brulard">his</person> Staff came over; also Generals <person name="Gen.Byng">Byng</person> and <person name="Davies">Davies</person>
with their Staffs. After bidding them farewell; a function whereat I was
grateful to the French for their lightness of touch, I rode over with
<person name="Walter_Braithwaite">Braithwaite</person> and the A.D.C.s to the new Headquarters at Kephalos to say
good-bye to my own Staff. Although I had meant to live there until we
drove the Turks far enough back to let us live on the Peninsula, I had
found time to see my little stone hut built by Greek peasants on the
side of the hill:--deliciously snug. To-day, this very day, I was to
have struck my tent and taken up these cosy winter quarters; now I move,
right enough, but on the wrong road.</p>

<p>The adieu was a melancholy affair. There was no make-belief, that's a
sure thing. Whatever the <location country="England">British</location> Officer may be his forte has never lain
in his acting. So, by 2.30, I made my last salute to the last of the old
lot and boarded the _<location ship="H.M.S. Triad">Triad</location>_. A baddish wrench parting from <person name="John_de_Robeck">de Robeck</person> and
<person name="Roger_Keyes">Keyes</person> with whom I have been close friends for so long. Up to midnight de
Robeck had intended coming home too. <person name="Roger_Keyes">Keyes</person> himself is following me in a
day or two, to implore the Cabinet to let us at least strike one more
blow before we haul down our flag, so there will be two of us at the
task.</p>

<p>I wrung their hands. The Bo'sun's whistle sounded. The curtain was
falling so I wrung their hands once again and said good-bye; good-bye
also to the <person name="Benjamin">Benjamin</person> of my personal Staff, young <person name="Alec">Alec</person>, who stays on with
<person name="Cpt.Birdwood">Birdie</person>. A bitter moment and hard to carry through.</p>

<p>Boarded the <location ship="H.M.S. Chatham">_Chatham_</location> (Captain Drury-Lowe) and went below to put my
cabin straight. The anchor came up, the screws went round. I wondered
whether I could stand the strain of seeing <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>, Kephalos, the camp,
fade into the region of dreams,--I was hesitating when a message came
from the Captain to say the Admiral begged me to run up on to the
quarter deck. So I ran, and found the <location ship="H.M.S. Chatham">_Chatham_</location> steering a corkscrew
course--threading in and out amongst the warships at anchor. Each as we
passed manned ship and sent us on our way with the cheers of brave men
ringing in our ears.</p>

<p>APPENDIX I</p>

<p>STATEMENT ON ARTILLERY BY BRIGADIER GENERAL SIR HUGH SIMPSON BAIKIE,
EX-COMMANDER OF THE BRITISH ARTILLERY AT CAPE HELLES.</p>


<p>The first landing of <location country="England">British</location> troops at Cape <location country="Greece">Helles</location> took place on 25th
April, 1915. On arriving at that place during the first week in May, I
found that heavy fighting had occurred without ceasing from the time of
the disembarkation. Having come straight from the Headquarters Staff of
the 2nd Army in <location country="France">France</location>, where the question of artillery ammunition was a
constant source of anxiety to all the higher commanders, I at once set
to work to discover what reserves remained in the hands of G.H.Q. and
what the daily expenditure had been since the landing. The greatest
difficulty was experienced in obtaining figures of expenditure from the
units, so constant had been the fighting, which still continued, and so
great the casualties, and consequent confusion in reckoning expenditure.
Yet, after some delay, sufficient information was obtained to enable me
to demonstrate with certainty that, if such severe fighting continued,
the Force would soon be in danger of losing their artillery support.</p>

<p>On the 4th May a cable was sent, I believe, to <person name="Herbert_Kitchener">Lord Kitchener</person> saying
that ammunition was becoming a very serious matter owing to the
ceaseless fighting; pointing out that 18 pr. shell were a vital
necessity and that a supply promised by a certain ship (I believe the
S.S. _Funia_) had not turned up. A day or two later, a cable was
received by G.H.Q. saying munitions were never calculated on a basis of
prolonged occupation of the Peninsula, and that the War Office would
have to reconsider the whole position, if more was wanted. If I remember
aright, the cable finished by saying, "It is important to push on." A
few days later a cable was received saying the War Office would not give
us more ammunition until we submitted a return of what was in hand. The
compilation of that cut-and-dried return in the midst of a desperate
battle was a distracting and never-to-be-forgotten effort, but there was
no help for it: no return, no shells; that was the War Office order. The
ammunition still in hand lay mostly in the holds of the ships at <location town="Mudros">Mudros</location>,
60 miles away, and did not lend themselves to easy counting; while the
actual expenditure was, for reasons already given, an intricate problem
indeed.</p>

<p>Continuous cables on the subject of ammunition passed during the next
few days between G.H.Q. and the War Office, all of which passed through
my hands and some of which I drafted for superior authority. I cannot
remember their sequence and not always their purport, but I distinctly
remember about the 10th or 11th May a cable being received from Lord
Kitchener saying ammunition for Field Artillery was being pushed out
_via_ Marseilles. I think the figures given were about ten or twenty
thousand rounds of 18-pr. and some one thousand rounds of 4.5 howitzer
H.E., but I am not sure.</p>

<p>The fact that does remain indelibly impressed on my mind is that I am
convinced from the cables that passed through my office that no
provision had been made by the War Office to keep up a regular supply of
artillery ammunition to the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> Expedition. The W.O. authority
appeared to have given a bonus of ammunition when the Expedition sailed,
and to have been somewhat taken aback and annoyed by the fact that a
sure and continuous supply should afterwards be demanded.</p>

<p>On 29th May I left G.H.Q. on appointment as Brigadier-General to command
all the artillery at Cape <location country="Greece">Helles</location>, in which capacity I served till
September, i.e. through all the big attacks and counter-attacks of June,
July and August. In this capacity I was brought face to face with all
the deficiencies in artillery _matériel_ and ammunition, of which the
following were the most important.</p>

<p>Although there was only one Battery of 4.5 and one Battery of 6-in.
howitzers at <location country="Greece">Helles</location> there was always an extreme deficiency of howitzer
H.E. ammunition. So great was the shortage that immediately on taking up
my command I found it necessary to issue a most stringent order that no
howitzer on Cape <location country="Greece">Helles</location> was ever to fire H.E. without my personal
authority. When the Turks attacked, 18-prs. and 15-prs. were to support
the Infantry with shrapnel; howitzers were only to be used with my
personal permission and then were only to fire shrapnel. All howitzer
H.E. was to be used exclusively for supporting <location country="England">British</location> attacks by
bombarding the <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> trenches before and during such activities.
Throughout the above months, constant appeals were made to me by
Infantry Commanders to bombard the <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> trenches with H.E. in order
to retaliate for the loss our men had suffered from the <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> guns
using H.E. Such requests I had invariably to refuse.</p>

<p>There were fifty-six 18-prs. at <location country="Greece">Helles</location>, when I assumed command on the
29th May, and subsequently they were increased to seventy-two at the end
of July. Except for 640 rounds of H.E., which was fired off during the
4th June battle, no more H.E. arrived till the end of July.</p>

<p>Never during my command did the total number of rounds of 18-pr.
ammunition at <location country="Greece">Helles</location> ever reach 25,000. Before one of our attacks, with
very careful previous husbanding, the total used perhaps to reach 19,000
to 23,000. The total amount I could therefore allot justifiably for the
artillery preparation before an attack of our four <location country="England">British</location> Infantry
Divisions never exceeded 12,000 rounds; as from 6,000 to 7,000 must
necessarily be kept in reserve to assist in beating off the determined
hostile counter-attacks. As I remarked at the beginning of this paper,
artillery ammunition was a constant anxiety to the higher commanders on
the Western Front also, but never, I believe, had Infantry to attack
with so little artillery support as the above. My position in <location country="France">France</location> did
not give me any inside knowledge of the details of artillery supply, but
in one action at St. Eloi (near Ypres) on 14th or 15th February, in
which only <unit type="division">27th Division</unit> was concerned, the artillery of this Division
(so the C.R.A. informed me) alone fired 10,000 18-pr. rounds in one
night. At a similar action at the same place by the same division about
a month later the divisional artillery fired, I believe, a slightly
larger amount. Again, at Neuve Chapelle, in February, 1915, each
Division had its own divisional artillery and the ammunition expenditure
worked out to 150 rounds per 18-pr. gun. These official figures were
shown me a few days after the battle by the G.O.C., 2nd Army.</p>

<p>In comparing the ammunition expenditure of <location country="France">France</location> in 1915 and in the
<location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location>, the enormous discrepancy in the number of 18-prs. per
Division must be taken into account. Reckoning on the scale of the
number of 18-prs. allotted to a <location country="England">British</location> Division in <location country="France">France</location>, we had at
<location country="Greece">Helles</location> little more than sufficient 18-prs. for one Division, yet with
this number we had to give artillery support to four Divisions. As to
the French artillery at <location country="Greece">Helles</location>, they could always reckon on being able
to expend 40,000 to 45,000 rounds when their two Divisions attacked.</p>

<p>The complete absence of H.E. was severely felt, as shrapnel were of
little use for destroying trenches, machine gun emplacements, etc.
Therefore, in each and every <location country="England">British</location> attack, success was jeopardized and
our infantry exposed to cruel losses, because, firstly, there was not
sufficient ammunition to prepare their attack, and, secondly, there was
no H.E. (except for howitzers) to destroy the machine guns in their
emplacements. The latter, therefore, inflicted great losses on our
Infantry in their advance.</p>

<p>Our unfortunate position did not escape the notice of the French, who
used at times generously to place under my command some of their field
guns and howitzers, but in the latter they were also lamentably
deficient, and in ammunition they were, themselves, during May and early
June, none too well provided, although towards July their reserves grew
more sufficient. The <location country="England">British</location> deficiency in ammunition, however, was so
great, and created so much merriment among the French that they
christened the <location country="England">British</location> Artillery, "Un coup par pièce"; with which term
of endearment I was always personally greeted by the French Artillery
General and his Staff, with all of whom I was great friends.</p>

<p>At the battle of 28th June the French were unable to spare us the
howitzers or ammunition we begged of them. The failure of the gallant
<unit type="brigade">156th</unit> Brigade of the <unit type="division">52nd Division</unit> to take the H.12 trenches was
essentially due to lack of artillery ammunition, especially of H.E.
Allowing for losses that must have been suffered under any condition, I
believe that some 700 or 800 Scottish casualties were due to this cause.
Before the action the Corps Commander sent for me to say that he did not
consider that enough guns and ammunition had been allotted to this
portion of the <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> trenches. I replied that I agreed, but that there
were no more available and that to reduce the bombardment of the
hostile trenches on the left of our front would gravely prejudice the
success of the <unit type="division">29th Division</unit> in that quarter and that I understood
success there was more vital than on our right flank. After consultation
with the G.O.C. <unit type="division">29th Division</unit>, the Corps Commander agreed with my
allotment of the artillery. We then did our utmost to obtain the loan of
more guns, howitzers or ammunition from the French without success and
with the result that the attack was beaten off.</p>

<p>So successful had been the attack on our left with its capture of five
successive lines of <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> trenches that we had actually some
ammunition to spare. In the afternoon it was agreed that there should be
another attack on H.12, preceded by a very short but very intense
bombardment from every gun and howitzer we possessed. All artillery
arrangements for this were completed before 2.30 p.m., from which hour
all the guns waited alert and ready for the Infantry to inform us of the
hour they wished us to commence fire. I was in direct telephonic
communication with the commander of the <unit type="division">52nd Division</unit>, having had a
private wire laid on to his Headquarters the previous day. Suddenly, to
my horror, I received a telephone message from my Artillery Group
Commander, Colonel Stockdale, saying the Infantry were making the
assault and that he had no time to do more than fire half a dozen shots!</p>

<p>In the attacks of 12th and 13th July, the French placed some thirty or
forty guns and howitzers under <location country="England">British</location> command, and on account of the
shortage of <location country="England">British</location> ammunition their guns undertook the whole of the
artillery preparation, our artillery confining itself to covering fire
during and after the Infantry advance. The counter-attacks were so
violent and the calls for artillery support were so incessant that
towards the afternoon of the 13th July the <location country="England">British</location> gun ammunition began
to get alarmingly low, until finally only about 5,000 rounds of 18-pr.
ammunition, including all rounds in Battery charge, remained at <location country="Greece">Helles</location>.
The French were reluctant to supply further artillery support, fearing
further attacks on themselves. This was the most anxious night I spent
on the Peninsula--all but a limited number of rounds were withdrawn from
most Batteries and were placed in horsed ammunition wagons, which
perambulated from one side of the <location country="England">British</location> position to the other
according to where it seemed most likely the next <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> attack would
take place. These measures were successful and no Battery actually was
left without one round at a critical moment, but the position throughout
that night was a most dangerous one. Every hour a wire was sent to
G.H.Q. giving expression to our crying needs, but there was next to
nothing at <location town="Mudros">Mudros</location>, while desperate fighting still went on without a
minute's respite. At 11 p.m. that night a trawler did, to the joy of
every gunner, reach <location country="Greece">Helles</location> with 3,000 rounds of 18-pr., but on the
arrival of my Staff Officer to unload it, it was found that the fuses
were of a new pattern never issued before and that the existing fuse
keys would not adjust the fuses. As no new pattern fuse keys had been
sent from home the Batteries had to manufacture their own, which was
successfully accomplished after two days' delay.</p>

<p>During June two Batteries, and during July two more Batteries of 5-inch
howitzers, manned by Territorials, arrived at <location country="Greece">Helles</location>. During the last
week of July the first two Batteries were sent to <location bay="Anzac">Anzac.</location> Some of these
howitzers were very old and worn by corrosion, and were consequently
inaccurate.</p>

<p>The Gun History sheets of some of them showed they had been used at the
Battle of Omdurman, seventeen years before, and had been in use ever
since. After the big <location country="England">British</location> attacks of 6th and 7th August, their
ammunition began to run short. On demand about 500 or 700 rounds were
sent up from <location town="Mudros">Mudros</location>--on arrival each shell was found to be of only 40
lb. weight, whereas former shells were of 50 lb. weight. Their fuses
were also of new pattern, which existing fuse keys would not fit and, to
crown all, no range tables had been sent for this new pattern of shell.
In spite of continual letters and telegrams to the War Office, when I
left <location country="Greece">Helles</location> in September no new pattern fuse keys or range tables had
ever arrived from <location country="England">England</location>; consequently these shells remained stacked on
the Peninsula while the Batteries only fired occasionally for want of
ammunition!</p>

<p>On another occasion, when we were in the greatest straits for 15-pr.
ammunition, many hundreds of rounds arrived at <location country="Greece">Helles</location>, which on being
landed were discovered by my Staff only to be suitable for the Ehrhardt
R.H.A. guns in <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location>, no such guns being in the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location>.</p>

<p>As for heavy artillery, practically speaking, there was none! Only one
6-inch Howitzer Battery (4 howitzers) and one 60-pr. Battery (4 guns)
were in action at <location country="Greece">Helles</location> up to July when four more guns of the latter
calibre were landed. Unfortunately, however, the 60-prs. were of little
use, as the recoil was too great for the carriages and the latter broke
down beyond repair by our limited resources after very few rounds. At
the beginning of August only one 60-pr. gun remained in action.
Consequently, we had no heavy guns capable of replying to the <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location>
heavy guns which enveloped us on three sides, and from whose fire our
infantry and artillery suffered severely.</p>

<p>As to spare parts, spare guns and carriages, such luxuries were
practically non-existent. No provision appears to have been made by the
War Office to replace our guns or their parts, which became
unserviceable through use or through damage by the hostile artillery. As
the <location country="England">British</location> were holding the lower slopes of the <location heights="Achi Baba">Achi Baba</location> position, and
as all our gun positions could be seen into by the Turks with powerful
spectacles from their observation posts on the top of <location heights="Achi Baba">Achi Baba</location>, our
equipment suffered severely. During June and July one 6-inch howitzer
and twenty-five 18-prs. (out of a total of seventy-two) as well as one
or two 60-prs., were put out of action by direct hits from the hostile
artillery. Such guns were withdrawn to the field workshops on "W" Beach,
but as these workshops were exposed to the enemy's artillery fire from
three sides, the guns were often further damaged while under repair.
Damaged guns had sometimes to wait for days in this workshop until other
guns had been damaged in a different place by the hostile artillery.
Then possibly one efficient gun could be made up of the undamaged
portions of one, two or more guns. Batteries often, therefore, remained
for days short of guns on account of the lack of spare parts.</p>

<p>When I assumed command of the artillery at <location country="Greece">Helles</location>, there were two
Batteries of mountain guns (10-prs.) in action, but they were of a
prehistoric pattern. In 1899 the Khedive of <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> possessed in his Army,
in which I was then serving, mountain guns which were more up-to-date in
every respect. So inaccurate were these 10-prs. that they had to be
placed close behind the front trenches lest they should hit our own
Infantry, the result being a very heavy casualty list in officers and
men amongst their Territorial personnel. Many of these lives could have
been saved, had reasonable modern weapons been supplied. These obsolete
old guns wore out so quickly that the two Batteries quickly melted into
one Battery, and when they finally left <location country="Greece">Helles</location> for Anzac at the end of
July, I believe only 3 guns and their detachments were left in being.</p>

<p>As for anti-aircraft guns, they did not exist at all and the hostile
aeroplanes used to fly over and drop bombs _ad lib._ without fear of
molestation, the only saving clause being that the enemy appeared to
possess almost as few aeroplanes as the <location country="England">British</location>.</p>

<p>In no point of their equipment did the force at <location country="Greece">Helles</location> suffer so much in
comparison with their comrades in <location country="France">France</location> as in the matter of aeroplanes
which, at the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location>, were hopelessly deficient not only in the
numbers but also in quality. There were not sufficient pilots and there
were no observers at all. Brave and efficient as the naval pilots were,
they could not be expected to be of any use as artillery spotters unless
they had been thoroughly trained for this important duty. This
deficiency had to be made good at all costs by drafting young artillery
subalterns from their Batteries and sending them to the Air Force, where
their lack of training and experience in operation was at first severely
felt, although later these lads did magnificent work. Thus Batteries
were deprived of their trained subalterns just at the moment when the
latter were most required on account of the severe casualties suffered
in the landing and during the subsequent early operations. But few of
the aeroplanes were fitted with wireless and the receivers on the ground
could not take in messages over a distance longer than 5,000 yards.
Consequently, each aeroplane had to return within this radius of the
receiver, before its observation could be delivered, thus immensely
curtailing the usefulness and efficiency of the aeroplane observation.
Owing to the above conditions, aeroplanes could only be used for the
counter-batteries firing on hostile artillery.</p>

<p>As regards trench mortars, the supply was hopelessly inadequate. I
cannot give the exact figures, but I believe there were not a dozen at
<location country="Greece">Helles</location> during the whole period I was there, and these were of such an
indifferent type as to be practically useless, and for this reason no
one bothered about them. No provision appears to have been made for the
supply of such necessities of trench warfare by the Home Authorities.
This appears to be indefensible, as I believe very early in the
operations their provision was specially asked for by G.H.Q. The
absolute failure to supply such articles of vital necessity eventually
led to the French C.-in-C. at <location country="Greece">Helles</location> lending the <location country="England">British</location> two demizel
trench mortars and large quantities of ammunition. These were manned by
artillery detachments, and by their magnificent work and the constant
demand from the Infantry for their services, it was conclusively proved
what an invaluable aid a sufficient supply of these weapons would have
been.</p>

<p>From the very first it was apparent to me that the number of <location country="England">British</location>
guns at <location country="Greece">Helles</location> was not sufficient to prepare and support simultaneous
Infantry attacks of the whole <location country="England">British</location> Force at this end of the
Peninsula. In June I drew up a memorandum to G.H.Q. pointing this out
and asking for a big increase of guns, howitzers and ammunition. What
happened to this I cannot say. I only know that the guns and ammunition
asked for never materialized.</p>

<p>The whole story of the artillery at <location country="Greece">Helles</location> may be summed up in the
following sentences: insufficiency of guns of every nature;
insufficiency of ammunition of every nature, especially of H.E.;
insufficient provision made by the Home Authorities for spare guns,
spare carriages, spare parts, adequate repairing workshops, or for a
regular daily, weekly or monthly supply of ammunition; guns provided
often of an obsolete pattern and so badly worn by previous use as to be
most inaccurate; lack of aeroplanes, trained observers and of all the
requisites for air observation; total failure to produce the trench
mortars and bombs to which the closeness of the opposing lines at <location country="Greece">Helles</location>
would have lent themselves well--in short, total lack of organization at
home to provide even the most rudimentary and indispensable artillery
requisites for daily consumption; not to speak of downright carelessness
which resulted in wrong shells being sent to the wrong guns, and new
types of fuses being sent without fuse keys and new types of howitzer
shells without range tables. These serious faults provoked their own
penalties in the shape of the heavy losses suffered by our Infantry and
artillery, which might have been to a great measure averted if
sufficient forethought and attention had been devoted to the "side-show"
at the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location>.</p>

<p>After commanding the starved artillery at <location country="Greece">Helles</location> it was my good fortune
to command the artillery of the 21st Army Corps at the third Battle of
Gaza, in November, 1917, and also at the great Battle of 19th
September, 1918, in which the Turks in Palestine were finally crushed,
and I think it may add emphasis to what I have said if I contrast the
artillery support of the two campaigns and show the results which
ensued. On the night before the third Battle of Gaza, the artillery
under my command (to support three Divisions) consisted of the
following, viz.:--19-1/2 Batteries (i.e., 78 guns and howitzers) of
heavy artillery, comprising 8-inch howitzers, 6-inch guns, 6-inch
howitzers and 60-pr. guns--all of the most modern and up-to-date type.</p>

<p>The Field Artillery comprised 108 18-prs. and 36 4.5 howitzers while in
addition there were 8 modern mountain howitzers and guns. There was not
an artillery weapon in the whole Army Corps that was not efficient and
up-to-date, while immediately behind the front line existed perfectly
organized workshops capable of executing any repairs. There was ample
provision of spare guns, carriages and parts, and an abundance of trench
mortars which, though they would have changed the whole face of the
Peninsula conflict, could not be used in Palestine owing to the breadth
of No Man's Land. Ammunition for every nature of gun and howitzer was
pressed upon us in profusion--over a thousand rounds per gun was buried
and concealed near every Battery, while immediately behind the fighting
line huge reserves were available for immediate use if required. At the
advanced railhead, G.H.Q. literally built mountains of ammunition as a
further supply; all this in addition to vast quantities stored in depôts
in <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> and on the banks of the Suez Canal. So great was the
superabundance of shell, that hundreds of tons were left lying on the
ground after the nine days' Battle at Gaza; which it took months to
remove. At the battle of the 19th September, 1918, in Palestine
conditions were exactly the same. There was an absolute _embarras de
richesse_ of every artillery requisite. This wealth of artillery
material was supported in Palestine by a full complement of artillery,
aeroplanes, pilots and observers, the latter being all thoroughly
trained and efficient. In addition, by a sufficiency of fighting
aeroplanes with most efficient pilots, our artillery were adequately
guarded from sunrise to sunset from any hostile aeroplane observation.</p>

<p>In short, our air supremacy was undisputed and absolutely protected our
own artillery against damage and molestation from the hostile guns. On
the other hand, the enemy's artillery lay at our mercy directly their
gun positions were discovered.</p>

<p>The whole science of artillery and aeroplane co-operation had, of
course, been vastly extended and perfected since <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location> days, but the
point I wish to make is this: that in 1917 and 1918 the Palestine Front
was fitted out on the same scale, proportionately, as the Western Front;
whereas in 1915 this was not the case in the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> as regards
artillery, for instance, only one Division (the 29th) at <location country="Greece">Helles</location> having
18-pr. guns and the Naval Division having been given no artillery at
all!</p>

<p>To put the matter shortly, whereas at <location country="Greece">Helles</location> I had under my command no
more than 88 to 95 guns and howitzers of all natures with scarcely any
ammunition or aeroplanes to support four <location country="England">British</location> Divisions; in Palestine
at Gaza I had at least 230 guns and howitzers (one-third of which were
of heavy calibre) with an abundance of ammunition and a sufficiency of
aeroplanes to support the attack of one and a half Divisions, the
remaining one and a half Divisions at Gaza being in reserve. At the
battle of 19th September, 1918, in Palestine I had, to the best of my
recollection, about 360 guns of all calibres to support four Divisions.
The terrible casualties suffered by our Infantry at <location country="Greece">Helles</location> are well
known, and my feelings as Artillery Commander unable to give them
anything like the support they would have had in <location country="France">France</location> or Flanders may
be guessed. But this was made up to me afterwards when I commanded the
artillery at Gaza, that strong fortress which was captured by the 21st
Army Corps, with certainly under 3,000 casualties and I believe with
under 2,000 killed and wounded. At Gaza the Turks were simply crushed by
our overwhelming artillery, fed from inexhaustible Ordnance parks and
dumps. Before the Infantry attack commenced the position was subjected
to a continuous bombardment night and day for six days and six nights
from every available gun and howitzer. The Infantry then attacked and
took a large portion of the position with a loss of, I believe, under
1,000 men. The Turks counter-attacked, but they melted away under the
tremendous artillery barrage and never attempted another during this
battle. Next night our Infantry tried to extend their conquest but the
Turks had meanwhile brought up an old <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location> Division, the 7th, which
held them at bay and inflicted upon them serious losses which, I
believe, increased their casualties to between two and three thousand.
The Corps Commander then decided to let the Infantry stand where they
were, to submit the Turks to a further three days' and three nights'
bombardment, at the end of which our Infantry advanced again only to
find that the Turks were evacuating the whole of the Gaza position.
After the Battle of 19th September, 1918, many Infantry commanders of
Divisions, Brigades and Battalions have told me the Turks appeared
crushed by the terrific artillery bombardment (under cover of which our
men advanced) and offered a resistance which, in comparison with our
experiences of <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location>, can only be called feeble.</p>

<p>The cardinal fact that remains in my mind is that in Palestine the 21st
Army Corps always had enough (and more than enough) of every artillery
requisite for whatever number of Divisions the Army Corps was composed
of; whereas, in <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location>, the VIIIth Army Corps at <location country="Greece">Helles</location>, which was
composed of four <location country="England">British</location> Divisions, never had enough Field Artillery or
ammunition to support more than one Division, and never possessed
sufficient heavy artillery to support more than one Infantry Brigade.</p>

<p>The material part of my statement ends here, and it only remains for me
to remind you that all the grievous shortcomings I have exposed were
actually made good by the heroism, devotion and sufferings of the
Officers and men of the Artillery at <location country="Greece">Helles</location>, both Regular, Territorial,
<location country="Australia">Australia</location> and <location country="New Zealand">New Zealand</location>. Rest was impossible, as no Battery could
ever be withdrawn from the line and all field Batteries were under rifle
fire. If placed outside that range, they were destroyed by flanking fire
from <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> guns in Asia. No dug-outs were possible, as dug-outs were
understood in <location country="France">France</location>, as there was no timber or roofing for their
construction. All ranks were thus exposed night and day to continuous
fire, and were sometimes killed as they slept in their valises by stray
bullets, thousands of which were fired unaimed every night by the Turks
in the hopes of inflicting casualties; water for drinking and washing
was almost as precious as guns and shells. The joys of a canteen, as was
at that time supplied by the War Office to our Army in <location country="France">France</location>, were
unknown; bare rations washed down by a limited allowance of water were
our only form of food; everyone suffered more or less from dysentery,
spread by the millions of flies which settled on every mouthful we ate
and made life almost insupportable by day. No Man's Land was one vast
litter of unburied corpses. Yet no man's spirit ever wavered and all
ranks remained as bright, as hopeful and as cheerful as on the day of
the first great landing. If shells were scarce, complaints were
non-existent; all were upheld by the wonderful religion of
self-sacrifice. It will ever remain my greatest pride that I had the
astonishing good fortune to be associated with such a body of officers
and men; to them I owe a debt of gratitude that is beyond redemption,
and to them alone is due the credit for any success which the artillery
at <location country="Greece">Helles</location> may have attained in what was one of <location country="England">England</location>'s greatest
tragedies, but was also one of <location country="England">England</location>'s greatest glories.</p>




<p>APPENDIX II</p>

<p>DARDANELLES EXPEDITION</p>

<p>     NOTES BY LIEUT.-COLONEL CHARLES ROSENTHAL,[17] COMMANDING 3RD
     AUSTRALIAN FIELD ARTILLERY BRIGADE, 1ST AUSTRALIAN DIVISION,
     RELATING TO ARTILLERY AT ANZAC, FROM 25TH APRIL TO 25TH AUGUST,
     1915. (_Compiled from personal diary._)</p>


<p>During the early hours of 25th April, 1915, the 3rd <location country="Australia">Australia</location> Infantry
Brigade landed on <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location> Peninsula, close to Gaba Tepe, at a point
now known as Anzac Beach, followed by other troops of 1st <location country="Australia">Australia</location>
Division and <location country="Australia">Australia</location> and <location country="New Zealand">New Zealand</location> Division.</p>

<p>Arrangements had been made for artillery to land about 10 a.m. on the
same morning, but owing to delays in disembarkation of Infantry, and
enemy shelling of transports necessitating ships temporarily leaving
their allotted anchorage, it was after mid-day before the vessels
carrying guns were actually in correct position for disembarkation.</p>

<p>I did not wait for the naval boats to come alongside, but after issuing
necessary instructions to Battery Commanders concerning the landing of
the guns, I disembarked in a ship's boat manned by a volunteer crew from
my Brigade Ammunition Column, accompanied by two officers and sixteen
men of my Headquarters' Staff.</p>

<p>Immediately on landing I reported to my C.R.A., and was by him informed
that the Divisional Commander had decided no artillery should land
during the day. This decision absolutely nonplussed me, and on asking
the reason I was informed the position was not considered sufficiently
secure to ensure the safety of guns, if emplaced. With this decision I
did not agree and urged, without result, that the safety of guns was
surely secondary to the proper supporting of the troops already
committed.</p>

<p>In view of the above decision instructions were at once sent off to the
ships ordering Colonel Johnstone, Commanding 2nd A.F.A. Brigade, and
Major Hughes, acting for me in command of 3rd A.F.A. Brigade, to defer
disembarkation of guns. Colonel Johnstone, however, by this time had one
18-pr. gun well on the way to the shore. Permission was given for it to
be landed and it was brought into action close to the beach against guns
at Gaba Tepe, undoubtedly temporarily silencing them.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Indian Mountain Battery attached to <unit type="division">1st Australia
Division</unit>, which had landed early in the day, was in action doing
splendid work though suffering severe casualties.</p>

<p>By the order of Colonel White, G.S.O. (1), 1st <location country="Australia">Australia</location> Division, I
spent the afternoon in collecting Infantry stragglers and getting them
forward again to the firing line. At 5 p.m. I reported completion of
this task and then proceeded to thoroughly reconnoitre the right flank,
overlooking Gaba Tepe, which had seemed to me, from observations made
from the ship, to be a suitable area for emplacing of guns.</p>

<p>I returned to Divisional Headquarters just before dark, and informed the
C.R.A. and Divisional Commander that I had found suitable places for
batteries and could use them effectively.</p>

<p>I had in my reconnaissance conferred with three Battalion Commanders
(one of whom was killed a couple of days later), who were delighted to
hear that the artillery they were so anxiously waiting for was to come
up in support.</p>

<p>After much discussion and persuasion the Divisional Commander agreed to
allow me to land two of my three 18-pr. batteries. This approval was
shortly afterwards altered to permission to land two guns only, and
finally all approval was cancelled, though no information of these
decisions officially reached me.</p>

<p>During the night, in anticipation of early arrival of guns, my
Headquarters personnel worked untiringly in preparing a track from the
beach to the selected sites for guns, and it was not till 5.30 a.m. on
26th that I learned approval to land guns had been cancelled overnight.</p>

<p>During the morning of 26th April one gun of 1st Battery, 1st Brigade,
and one gun of 4th Battery, 2nd Brigade, were landed, hauled up the
steep hill to their positions, and came into action on the extreme right
of ridge overlooking Gaba Tepe.</p>

<p>Later in the day the 7th Battery of my Brigade came into action on the
same ridge and the single guns of 1st and 4th Batteries were withdrawn
for return to their respective Brigades.</p>

<p>During the afternoon there also came ashore, apparently without order,
  two guns of 3rd Battery, 1st Brigade, and 8th Battery, 3rd Brigade, but
were returned to their respective ships by the C.R.A.</p>

<p>My guns were placed absolutely in the Infantry front trenches, on the
sky line, no troops of any kind being in advance of them. It would have
been quite useless to take up positions behind the Infantry line in the
normal way, owing to the configuration of the ground, for in such cases
the lowest range at which the crest could be cleared was 3,000 yards,
while our targets were from 500 to 1,000 yards distant. Indeed at night,
shrapnel shell with fuse set at zero was frequently used.</p>

<p>Each gun fired during the 26th about 400 rounds, over open sights, and
caused very heavy casualties to the enemy.</p>

<p>The whole battery covered a front of 187°, necessitating each gun being
personally controlled by an officer and each with its own particular arc
of fire.</p>

<p>The supply of ammunition was very difficult. It had to be delivered by
hand to the guns over a bullet-swept area, the distance from the beach
to the guns being about half a mile, while in this distance the hills
rose 400 feet.</p>

  <p>By the afternoon of the 3rd May, two guns of 8th Battery, 3rd Brigade,
were in action, and 2nd Brigade also had guns in position on the left
flank of 1st <location country="Australia">Australia</location> Divisional Front.</p>

<p>The <location country="Australia">Australia</location> and <location country="New Zealand">New Zealand</location> Division also had 18-prs. in action
together with two 4.5-inch Howitzer Batteries, the latter being the only
howitzers available up to this time at Anzac.</p>

<p>I was wounded on 5th May, evacuated to Cairo, and did not rejoin my
command at Anzac till 26th May. During this interval gun positions, as
well as Infantry trenches, had been much improved, and the enemy country
in our immediate front which, when I left on 5th May, gave no signs of
life, was now well traversed by trenches.</p>

<p>I found in my sector that the guns of my Brigade were now all in action,
and the remainder of the artillery of the Division was also emplaced.</p>

<p>About this time 6-inch howitzers were made available and later emplaced,
one for left sector, one for the centre, and one for the right, but with
very limited quantities of ammunition. Another 6-inch howitzer was
landed on 17th June.</p>

<p>I had made continual urgent representations for two 4.7-inch guns for
right flank to deal with innumerable targets beyond the range of
18-prs., but it was not till 11th July that one very old and much worn
gun arrived, and was placed in position on right flank, firing its first
round on 26th July.</p>

  <p>On 24th June a Scottish Territorial Howitzer Battery (the 5th Battery,
City of Glasgow Lowland Howitzer Brigade) arrived and came under my
command.</p>

<p>On 14th July a heavy battery was organized for right flank, consisting
of the two 6-inch howitzers and the 4.7-inch gun before mentioned, but
ammunition was still very scarce.</p>

<p>On 15th July a 5-inch Howitzer Brigade under Colonel Hope Johnstone
commenced to arrive and was complete in position by 18th July.</p>

  <p>On 28th July the 4th Battery of Lowland Brigade arrived.</p>

<p>About this time some alterations were made in artillery dispositions and
grouping in preparation for impending battle at <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay and Lone Pine,
commencing on 6th August, and on 30th July the artillery of right sector
under my command was as follows:--</p>

<p>  3rd A.F.A. Brigade (18-prs.).
  Heavy Battery (two 6-inch howitzers and one 4.7-inch gun).
  2 Mountain Guns.
  Two 5-inch Howitzer Batteries, Lowland Brigade.
  One 5-inch Howitzer Battery, 69th Brigade.</p>

<p>When leaving <location country="Australia">Australia</location> in 1914 I had urged that a battery of 5-inch
howitzers (which I commanded prior to the outbreak of war), together
with stocks of ammunition held by <location country="Australia">Australia</location>, should accompany 1st
<location country="Australia">Australia</location> Division. This was not approved. On arrival at <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location>
Peninsula, when the need for howitzers was at once apparent, I again
re-opened the question, particularly on the 29th May, when the C.R.A.
agreed to press for them to be sent forward. The Divisional Commander,
on 25th June, cabled <location country="Australia">Australia</location> definitely asking for this battery, which
was at once forwarded, but arrived at the Peninsula too late to be of
any service.</p>

<p>Two <location country="Australia">Australia</location> Field Batteries (together with a Brigade of Infantry)
were transferred to Cape <location country="Greece">Helles</location> on 5th May and did not rejoin the
<location country="Australia">Australia</location> Division at Anzac till 18th August.</p>

<p>With the limited number of guns available it was exceedingly important
that transfers might be made very rapidly from one part of our front to
another, and on 2nd June I put forward a proposal which was approved
immediately to make a road along the entire front just behind the crest
on which infantry trenches were sited. This road was completed in about
two weeks and was a great boon alike to gunners and Infantry.</p>

<p>Up to 24th August no anti-aircraft guns had been provided, but specially
constructed emplacements had been made for 18-prs. to be used against
aircraft, and though never successful in bringing down an enemy 'plane
they certainly made good enough shooting to cause enemy aviators to
treat them with respect. About 20th August three 3-pr. Hotchkiss arrived
for anti-aircraft purposes. They were of obsolete pattern and had been
manufactured for the Japanese Government many years before. In fact the
only range tables provided were printed in Japanese, but thanks to the
fact that one of my Sergeants (who was a Master Mariner) spoke Japanese,
we succeeded in preparing serviceable range tables.</p>

<p>Two Japanese trench mortars were also used from Infantry trenches with
excellent effect, but owing to ammunition supply becoming soon exhausted
and no fresh supplies being available they had to be discarded. A good
supply of these weapons, together with full supplies of ammunition,
would have been invaluable in bombarding enemy front line trenches.</p>

<p>The ammunition supply at all times up to the operation of 6th August was
a difficult problem. Frequently we had to be rationed to a very small
allowance per battery per day, and the guns of the heavy battery were
for some time not permitted to fire more than two rounds per day and
then only by special permission of the C.R.A.</p>

<p>On 20th June I was first informed that H.E. for 18-pr. was to be
supplied, and shortly afterwards a small supply for experiment was
landed at Anzac. I think I am right in saying my share was 15 rounds per
battery.</p>

<p>On 2nd August our first supply of H.E. arrived, but only 150 rounds per
battery.</p>

<p>During the first few months of the campaign, when our stocks of
ammunition were desperately low, our guns and gunners had to suffer
considerable casualties without being able to effectively reply.</p>

<p>Our batteries were of necessity in many cases under direct observation
of the enemy, and only the splendid work of the detachments in building
earthworks for their protection made it possible to carry on.</p>

<p>Under the protection of the banks of a small ravine near the beach, our
artificers established a workshop, and the extraordinary ingenuity and
skill displayed in the repairing and replacing of damaged guns earned
for the artificers our most grateful appreciation and thanks.</p>

<p>On 25th August I was evacuated suffering from enteric.</p>

<p>These notes only apply to the right sector, which I commanded.</p>

<p>APPENDIX III</p>


<p>The Dispatch of a Commander-in-Chief is not a technical document. In it
the situation should be set forth, as briefly and clearly as may be,
together with a few words indicative of the plan of G.H.Q. for coping
with it. After that comes a narrative which ends with thanks to those
individuals and units who have earned them. A Dispatch should be so
written that civilians can follow the facts stated without trouble: it
should not be too technical. But when the Military Colleges and
Academies at Camberley, Duntroon, Kingston, West Point and in the
European and Japanese capitals set to work in a scientific spirit to
apportion praise or blame they are more influenced by the actual
instructions and orders issued by the Commander-in-Chief _before and
during the battle_, than by any after-the-event stories of what
happened. They are glad to know the intentions of the Commander, but his
instructions i.e., the actual steps he took to give practical effect to
those intentions, are what really interest them.</p>

<p>When I came to write my Dispatch of the 11th December, so much about the
actual course of events at <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> was still obscure, that it had become
desirable either to write the narrative in a more technical form than
was customary or else to publish my actual instructions simultaneously
with the Dispatch. I chose the latter course. The authorities had raised
objections to several passages in the Dispatch, and in every case but
one, where they had wished me to add something which was not, in my
opinion, correct, I had met them. No objection had been raised to the
inclusion of my instructions. At 9 p.m. on the night of the 6th January
(the Dispatch being due to appear next morning) I received a letter by
Special Messenger from the War Office telling me the Press Bureau were
wiring to all those to whom the Dispatch had been issued to suppress the
instructions!</p>

<p>Whatever the reason of this action may have been, its result was clear
enough: my Dispatch was eviscerated at the very moment it was stepping
on to the platform. Had I known that these instructions, now given, were
to have been cut out, my Dispatch would have been differently written.</p>

<p>                                                    IAN H., 1920.</p>


<p>SIR IAN HAMILTON'S INSTRUCTIONS.</p>


<p>  TO VICE-ADMIRAL, COMMANDING
  EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN SQUADRON,</p>

<p>                                                _17th July, 1915._</p>

<p>SIR,--I have the honour to forward a series of tables drawn up to show
in detail the men, animals, vehicles, stores, etc., which it will be
required to land in connection with the forthcoming operations. I shall
be grateful if you will let me know as early as possible if you consider
that any part of the programme indicated presents especially serious
difficulties or is likely to require modification.</p>

<p>In informing me of the results of your consideration, I shall be obliged
if you will let me know what craft you intend to use in carrying out the
disembarkations referred to in tables B, C, D and E, so that detailed
arrangements with regard to embarkation and to the allocation of troops,
etc., to boats may be prepared.</p>

<p>2. Immediately after the disembarkation of the details referred to in
the attached tables it will be necessary, if the operations are
successful, to land 5,000 to 7,000 horses in order to render the force
sufficiently mobile to carry the operations to a conclusion. Details as
to disembarkation of these horses will be forwarded to you later. In the
meantime the horses will be collected at <location city="Alexandria">Alexandria</location>, and should
subsequently be brought up to <location town="Mudros">Mudros</location> or <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>, to begin arriving on
August 6th.</p>

<p>It will also be necessary to land the remaining portions of the units
referred to in the tables (first line transport, etc.), and, further,
the remaining units of the formations to which they belong. In this
latter category will be included three batteries of heavy artillery with
mechanical transport. It will not be required to land any of the above
until after August 7th, and details as to numbers, order of
disembarkation, etc., will be forwarded to you later.</p>

<p>                    I have the honour to be, Sir,
                                 Your obedient Servant,
                                    (_Signed_) IAN HAMILTON,</p>

<p>                                            _General, Commanding_
                              _Mediterranean Expeditionary Force._</p>

<p>  GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING,</p>

<p>  AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND ARMY CORPS.</p>

<p>With reference to your G.288 of 15th July, the Navy is being asked to
provide transport for the following ammunition to be landed at Anzac by
the 3rd August:--</p>



<p>_For A. and N.Z.A.C._--Sufficient S.A.A. to bring the amount on shore up
to 500 rounds per rifle and 27,500 per machine-gun.</p>

<p>_For other Troops._--300 rounds per rifle and 24,000 rounds per
machine-gun (in addition to what the troops will carry on landing).</p>

<p>These will come to 10,000,000 rounds in all, and arrangements are being
made to begin landing this ammunition as soon as possible.</p>

<p>2. The following artillery ammunition will also have to be gradually
landed and stored, and should all be ashore, if possible, by August
3rd:--</p>

<p>  10 pr.                                  5,700 rounds
  18 pr. (probably 15 per cent. H.E.)    15,500 "
  4.5-in. Howitzer probably half H.E.     1,600 "
  5-in. Howitzer majority H.E.           10,000 "
  6-in. Howitzer majority H.E.            1,200 "
  60 pr. probably two-thirds H.E.         1,000 "</p>

<p>All of this ammunition is not yet arrived, and the proportion of H.E.
shell is not yet ascertainable from <location country="England">England</location>. The arrangements suggested
in your paragraph 2 (iii.) of your letter are noted, and will be
followed as far as possible.</p>

<p>3. With regard to the marking of ammunition-boxes, the necessary
arrangements are being prepared. You will be informed of the
arrangements and of the system of marking in due course.</p>

<p>Consignments of Mark VI. and Mark VII. will be sent separately as you
suggest.</p>

<p>4. The above figures do not include the periodical replenishment
referred to in paragraph 2 (iv.) of your letter. Dispatch of
consignments on this account and consignments for the reserve will be
notified to you separately.</p>

<p>                                    (_Signed_) W. P. BRAITHWAITE,</p>

<p>                                          _Major-General, C.G.S.,_
                             _Mediterranean Expeditionary Force._</p>

<p>Enclosed a copy of tables forwarded to Vice-Admiral, showing troops,
animals, stores, etc., which the Navy is being asked to land at Anzac.</p>

<p>                                               _22nd July, 1915._</p>

<p>  GENERAL OFFICES COMMANDING,
         9TH CORPS.</p>

<p>The General Commanding wishes me to send you the following outline of
his plans for the next general attack, for the exclusive information of
yourself, your Divisional Generals, and such Officers of your Corps
Headquarters and Divisional Headquarters as you may consider it
necessary to take into your confidence. I am to add that it is Sir Ian's
wish that as few officers as possible should be made acquainted with it.</p>

<p>2. The general plan is, while holding as many of the enemy as possible
in the southern theatre, to throw the weight of our attack on the
<location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> forces now opposite the <location country="Australia">Australia</location> and <location country="New Zealand">New Zealand</location> Army Corps.
It is hoped, by means of an attack on the front and right flank of these
forces, to deal them a crushing blow, and to drive the remnants south
towards Kilid Bahr. It will then be the object of the General Commanding
to seize a position across the peninsula from Gaba Tepe to Maidos with a
protected line of supply from <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay.</p>

<p>3. The strength of the enemy north of Kilid Bahr at the present time is
about 30,000 men. Of these some 12,000 are permanently maintained in the
trenches opposite the Anzac position, and the majority of the remainder
are held in reserve at Boghali, Kojadere and Eski-Keui. It is believed
that there are about three battalions in the Anafarta villages, a
battalion at Ismail Oglu Tepe (New map 1/20,000), a battalion near
Yilghin Burnu, and small parties of outposts at Lala Baba (Sq. 104.L.)
and Ghazi Baba (Sq. 106.N.). The hills due east of <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay towards Aji
Liman are believed to be held only by a few Gendarmerie, but
information on this point is at present not precise. The hills near
Yilghin Burnu and Ismail Oglu Tepe are known to contain one 4.7-in. gun,
one 9.2-in. gun, and three field guns, protected by wire entanglements
and infantry trenches, but it is believed that the main defences are
against attack from the south or west, and that there is no wire on the
northern slopes of the hills; also that the guns can only be fired in a
southerly direction.</p>

<p>4. The success of the plan outlined in paragraph 2 will depend on two
main factors:--</p>

<p>  (a) The capture of Hill 305 (Sq. 93.W.).</p>

<p>  (b) The capture and retention of <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay as a base
  of operations for the northern army.</p>

<p>5. The operations from within the present Anzac position against the
enemy on Hill 305 will be carried out by the <location country="Australia">Australia</location> and <location country="New Zealand">New Zealand</location>
Corps, temporarily reinforced by the following units of the 9th Army
Corps:--</p>

<p>  <unit type="division">13th Division</unit> (less 66th, 67th and 68th Brigades, R.F.A.).</p>

<p>  29th Infantry Brigade (10th Division).</p>

<p>  29th <location country="India">Indian</location> Brigade.</p>

<p>  69th Howitzer Brigade, R.F.A.</p>

<p>6. The landing near <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> will be entrusted to you, and you will have at
your disposal:--</p>

<p>  11th Division.</p>

<p>  10th Division (less 29th Brigade).</p>

<p>  Highland Mountain Artillery Brigade.</p>

<p>  1st/4th Lowland Howitzer Brigade.</p>

<p>The disembarkation of your command, which may be expected to be opposed,
though not in great strength, will be after dark at a point immediately
south of Lala Baba. The first troops to disembark will be the 11th
Division, which will have been concentrated at <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location> previously to the
attack, and will be brought across under cover of darkness in destroyers
and motor-lighters. It is expected that approximately 4,000 men will be
disembarked simultaneously, and that three infantry brigades and the
mountain artillery brigade will be ashore before daylight.</p>

<p>Your first objectives will be the high ground at Lala Baba and Ghazi
Baba, and the hills near Yilghin Burnu and Ismail Oglu Tepe. It will
also be necessary to send a small force to secure a footing on the hills
due east of <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay. It is of first importance that Yilghin Burnu and
Ismail Oglu Tepe should be captured by a coup-de-main before daylight in
order to prevent the guns which they contain being used against our
troops on Hill 305 and to safeguard our hold on <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay. It is hoped
that one division will be sufficient for the attainment of these
objectives.</p>

<p>Your subsequent moves will depend on circumstances which cannot at
present be gauged, but it is hoped that the remainder of your force will
be available on the morning of the 7th August to advance on Biyuk
Anafarta with the object of moving up the eastern spurs of Hill 305 so
as to assist General Birdwood's attack.</p>

<p>7. The operations from within the present Anzac position will begin
during the day immediately preceding your disembarkation (the
reinforcements for General Birdwood's force having been dribbled ashore
in detachments at Anzac Cove on the three previous nights). The
operations will begin with a determined attack on the <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> left
centre, Lonesome Pine and Johnston's Jolly (see enlarged map of Anzac
position), with the object of attracting the enemy's reserves to this
portion of the line. The Turks have for long been apprehensive of our
landing in the neighbourhood of Gaba Tepe, and it is hoped that an
attack in force in this quarter will confirm their apprehensions. At
nightfall the <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> outposts on the extreme right of the enemy's line
will be rushed, and a force of 20,000 men will advance in three or more
columns up the ravines running down from Chunuk Bair. This advance,
which will begin about the same time as your first troops reach the
shore, will be so timed as to reach the summit of the main ridge near
Chunuk Bair about 2.30 a.m. (soon after moon-rise).</p>

<p>Latest photographs show that the <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> trenches on this ridge do not
extend further north than Chunuk Bair, and it is unlikely that the
higher portions of the ridge are held in great strength.</p>

<p>As soon as a lodgement has been effected on this ridge a portion of the
attacking force will be left to consolidate the position gained and the
remainder will advance south-west against the enemy's trenches near Baby
700, which will be attacked simultaneously by a special detachment from
within the Anzac position.</p>

<p>An advance by your force from the east will, as already indicated in
paragraph 6, be of great assistance in the event of this attack being
checked.</p>

<p>8. The landing of sufficient transport to secure the mobility of your
force will be a matter of considerable difficulty. No animals or
vehicles of any kind will be able to land in the first instance, and
machine-guns, tools and necessary medical and signalling equipment must
be carried by hand. All men will land with two iron rations (one day's
meat ration only is advised); infantry will carry 200 rounds S.A.A. and
machine-gun sections 3,500 rounds in belt boxes. Packs and greatcoats
will not be taken ashore. Before dawn it is hoped to land enough horses
to secure the mobility of the mountain artillery brigade and one battery
R.F.A., and it is hoped that within the first 24 hours the
disembarkation of all the personnel, horses and vehicles enumerated in
the attached table will be complete.</p>

<p>One brigade R.F.A. 11th Division, 1/4th Lowland 5th Howitzer Brigade
(two batteries) and the 10th Heavy Battery, will be landed at Anzac
before the operations commence, and their personnel and horses will
disembark on the morning following your disembarkation, and will then be
directed along the beach to join your command.</p>

<p>Water is plentiful throughout the Anafarta Valley, but pending the
disembarkation of water carts a number of mules with special 8-gallon
water bags will be attached to the units of your command.</p>

<p>                                 (_Signed_) W. P. BRAITHWAITE,</p>

<p>                                      _Major-General, C.G.S._,
                          _Mediterranean Expeditionary Force_.</p>

<p>P.S.--This letter is never to be out of an officer's possession, and if,
as is probable, you require to send it to your Brig.-Gen. G.S., it must
be sent to <location town="Mudros">Mudros</location> in charge of an officer.</p>

a.m., and must be extinguished by 8 p.m. Green wood is not to be used;
the smoke it causes will draw shell fire.</p>

<p>8. No troops are to leave the area allotted to them between 4 a.m. and 8
p.m. except on special duty with the authority of the Brigade Commander.
Piquets will be placed under area arrangements at intervals round the
area to prevent men straying independently.</p>

<p>9. Troops may be exposed to desultory shelling during the day or night.
This is never aimed, and the best protection against it is to move into
the bottom of the gully in which the troops are bivouacked.</p>

<p>10. Troops are not to use any portion of the iron ration with which they
land. Issues will be made under brigade arrangements of rations and
extras to last the period of their stay.</p>

<p>11. Water is issued on ration at one gallon fresh water per day. This
includes water for all purposes. For bathing, the sea is available, but
may only be visited after 9 p.m. daily.</p>

<p>12. Latrines for immediate use are dug and marked in each area;
additional latrines are to be prepared by units and the strictest
orders issued to prevent fouling the ground. Latrines are to be made
very deep, as space is much restricted.</p>

<p>13. Casualties of any kind after treatment in the field ambulance
affiliated to the brigade will be taken to the casualty clearing station
in Anzac Cove for removal to Hospital Ship.</p>

<p>Urgent cases at any time; others as far as possible between 7.30 and
8.30 p.m. and between 6 and 9 a.m.</p>

<p>14. The following is to be practised by all troops after landing:--</p>



<p>Falling in once during the night in any close formation, and to remain
so closed up for a period of at least half an hour, during which passing
of commands (messages from front to rear and back again and to the
flanks) is to be practised.</p>

<p>The troops must be accustomed to the starlight, which may be expected
during night operations.</p>

<p>15. If aeroplanes pass overhead troops are not to look up, as this will
give away the position of bodies of troops and probably draw shell fire.</p>

<p>16. Troops landing should be provided with Maps 1/20,000 of the area in
which operations are to take place. These maps to be in bulk, and not
issued till after landing.</p>

<p>Maps 1/10,000 of the Anzac area showing roads and bivouacs will be
issued to unit commanders on arrival.</p>

<p>17. Telephone lines will be found laid from Anzac Headquarters to points
suitable for Brigade or higher Headquarters. On arrival brigades will
join up these points to Anzac.</p>

<p>An officer and two orderlies per brigade will also be detailed to remain
at Anzac Headquarters.</p>

<p>Staffs of formations higher than brigades will be located within easy
reach of Anzac Headquarters.</p>



<p>G.S.R. Z. 18/2.</p>

<p>_Instructions for G.O.C. 9th Army Corps._</p>

<p>Reference Sheet Anafarta Sagir <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location> Map 1/20,000.</p>

<p>1. The intentions of the General Commanding for the impending
operations, and a rough outline of the task which he has allotted to the
troops under your command, were communicated to you in my G.S.R. Z. 18,
dated 22nd instant.</p>

<p>2. In addition to the information contained in paragraph 3 of the above
quoted letter, small numbers of <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> mounted troops and Gendarmerie
have been reported in the country north of Anzac, and three guns with
limbers, each drawn by six oxen, have been seen moving into Anafarta
Sagir. An aeroplane photograph has also disclosed the presence of a few
trenches on Lala Baba. A sketch of these trenches, which have apparently
been constructed for some months, is attached. It is believed that the
channel connecting the Salt Lake with <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay is now dry.</p>

<p>3. Your landing will begin on the night 6th/7th August. Your primary
objective will be to secure <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay as a base for all the forces
operating in the northern zone. Owing to the difficult nature of the
terrain, it is possible that the attainment of this objective will, in
the first instance, require the use of the whole of the troops at your
disposal. Should, however, you find it possible to achieve this object
with only a portion of your force, your next step will be to give such
direct assistance as is in your power to the G.O.C. Anzac in his attack
on Hill 305, by an advance on Biyuk Anafarta, with the object of moving
up the eastern spurs of that hill.</p>

<p>4. Subject only to his final approval, the General Commanding gives you
an entirely free hand in the selection of your plan of operations.</p>

<p>He, however, directs your special attention to the fact that the hills
Yilghin and Ismail Oglu Tepe are known to contain guns which can bring
fire to bear on the flank and rear of an attack on Hill 305, and that on
this account they assume an even greater importance in the first
instance than if they were considered merely part of a position covering
<location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay. If, therefore, it is possible, without prejudice to the
attainment of your primary objective, to gain possession of these hills
at an early period of your attack, it will greatly facilitate the
capture and retention of Hill 305. It would also appear almost certain
that until these hills are in your possession it will be impossible to
land either troops or stores in the neighbourhood of <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay by day.</p>

<p>5. The troops at your disposal will be:--</p>

<p>11th Division (less one Brigade R.F.A., at <location country="Greece">Helles</location>).</p>

<p>10th Division (less 29th Infantry Brigade).</p>

<p>Three squadrons R.N. Armoured Car Division, R.N.A.S. (one squadron motor
cycles, six machine guns; one squadron Ford cars, six machine guns; one
squadron armoured cars, six machine guns).</p>

<p>Two Highland Mountain Artillery batteries.</p>

<p>An endeavour will be made to release for your force one or more 5-in.
howitzer batteries, now at Anzac, during the day following your initial
disembarkation.</p>

<p>6. In order that you may be able to arrange for the disembarkation of
your force to agree, so far as Naval exigencies will admit, with the
plan of operations on which you decide, the allocation of troops to the
ships and boats to be provided by the Navy is left to your decision.</p>

<p>With this object, tables have been drawn up, and are enclosed with these
instructions, showing the craft which can be placed at your disposal by
the Navy, their capacity, and the points at which the troops can be
disembarked. The tables also show what numbers of troops, animals,
vehicles, and stores can be landed simultaneously.</p>

<p>The beaches available for your landing on the first night are (1) a
frontage of 600 yards in <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay (sq. 117 Q.V.); (2) a frontage of
1,800 yards S. of Kuchuk Kemikli (sq. 9, 103 z, 104 V; 91 A.B.), called
"New Beach" in the tables. It will not be possible in the first instance
to land more than one brigade of your force in <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay, though other
vessels can simultaneously be discharging their passengers on New Beach.</p>

<p>7. As regards the time at which the disembarkation may be expected to
commence, no craft will be allowed to leave Kephalos Harbour till after
dark, and the passage across will take from one and a half to two hours.
It is unsafe, therefore, to count on any troops being ashore before
10.30 p.m., and in no case must your approach be disclosed to the enemy
till 10 p.m., the hour at which the outposts on the left flank of the
Anzac position are to be rushed.</p>

<p>8. No allowance has been made in the tables for the disembarkation of
your headquarters, as it is not known at what period of the operations
you will wish them to land.</p>

<p>9. Special attention is directed to paragraph 8 of my letter G.S.R. Z.
18, dated 22nd July.</p>

<p>10. The infantry of the <unit type="division">53rd Division</unit> will be available as Army Reserve,
and will be at the disposal of the General Commanding.</p>

<p>11. Special instructions regarding signal communications will be issued
later. In general terms the arrangements will be as follows:--</p>



<p>There is a submarine cable between <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location> and Anzac, and a cable will be
laid as soon as practicable from <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location> to <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay. A submarine cable
and a land cable will also be laid between Anzac and <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay as soon
as circumstances permit, probably before dawn. Pending the completion of
this work inter-communication between Anzac and <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay will be
carried out by lamp, and, subject to Naval approval, between <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay
and <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location> by wireless telegraphy.</p>

<p>Two[18] military pack W.T. stations and one R.N. Base W.T. station will
be provided at <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay, four naval ratings will be attached to each
station as visual signalling personnel. One of these military pack W.T.
stations will be disembarked with the second brigade to land, and will
act as a base station pending the arrival of the R.N. Base wireless
station. The second military pack W.T. station will be disembarked with
the third brigade to land; it will be placed on a flank and used mainly
for fire control under the B.G.R.A.</p>

<p>A wagon wireless station at G.H.Q., <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>, will be in communication
with both these pack W.T. stations.</p>

<p>One officer and 23 other ranks, with two pack animals from the Brigade
Signal Section, will be landed with each Infantry Brigade.</p>

<p>These parties will lay their cable by hand and establish telephone and
vibrator communication from the beach forward. No vehicles will be
landed in the first instance, all necessary stores being man-handled.</p>

<p>Three officers, 74 other ranks, 28 animals and five vehicles will be
landed with Divisional Headquarters.</p>

<p>The advance parties will release the brigade sections from the beach and
be prepared to lay cable lines by hand.</p>

<p>Two cable wagons will be included in the five vehicles, and should be
the first of those vehicles to be disembarked.</p>

<p>The 10 motor lighters will land their complements first, and then the troops
from the 10 Destroyers, the two sloops and their tows, and the trawler and her
tows, can proceed simultaneously on a front of about 600 yards in <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay and
1,800 on the beach south of <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay, directly beach secured. The two landing
places are about 2 miles apart. The landing of the troops from H.M.S.
_Endymion_ and _Theseus_ may be able to take place simultaneously, or
may have to be deferred until the motor lighters have cleared the destroyers.</p>

                                 Mediterranean Expeditionary Force.
                                                 29th July, 1915._</p>


<p>  G.S.R. Z. 18/2.                                    _July 29th._</p>

<p>  GENERAL OFFICER COMMANDING,
          8TH CORPS.</p>

<p>The General Commanding has decided that his next main attack shall be
made in the vicinity of Anzac with the object of placing ourselves
astride the Peninsula to the north of Kilid Bahr.</p>

<p>2. The 8th Corps with attached troops is to assist this main operation
by offensive action in the south, the scope and form of this action
being determined solely with reference to its effects on the main
operation.</p>

<p>As the decisive point will be in the neighbourhood of Anzac, all
reinforcements will be utilized in that theatre, and it is improbable
that any will be available for the southern zone before the middle of
August, except such drafts for the 8th Corps and the Corps Exp. Orient
as may reach the Peninsula in the next ten days.</p>

<p>3. In order to free sufficient troops to enable the 8th Corps to take
the offensive, the French will take over part of the line as defined in
Force Order No. 22.</p>

<p>4. In addition to the troops of the 8th Corps and R.N.D. at present at
your disposal, the following reinforcements may be expected:--</p>

<p>  29th Division       280 due 29th July.
  29th Division       900 due 4th August.
  <unit type="division">42nd Division</unit>       100 due 29th July.
                    -----
  Total             1,280</p>

<p>which, allowing for normal wastage, should give an effective total of
24,780 on 5th August. These numbers, with the shorter line you will be
called upon to hold, should leave you with sufficient troops to
undertake a limited offensive operation on or about that day.</p>

<p>5. Assuming that you are not attacked in the meanwhile, the total amount
of ammunition which should be available at <location country="Greece">Helles</location> early in August for
offensive action, and to maintain a reserve is:--</p>

<p>  18 pr.       36,000   }
  4.5 inch      2,000   }    Plus any amounts saved
  5 inch        4,000   }    from normal daily expenditure.
  6 inch          545   }
  60 pr.        3,000   }</p>

<p>but it must be borne in mind that no replacements can be looked for
before August 16th.</p>

<p>6. The scope of your offensive action must be based upon these figures,
and it is thought that the most suitable objective will be the capture
of the <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> trenches up to the line F. 13, G. 13, H. 13, and H. 12.
Plans for this operation should, therefore, be undertaken at once.</p>

<p>7. Pre-supposing that this attack is successful, and that the numbers at
your disposal admit of a further advance, the capture of the trenches on
the line H. 14 to H. 15, followed perhaps by the capture of Krithia
could then be undertaken, and plans for this action should be prepared
beforehand. But as the launching of this further attack must be entirely
dependent on unknown factors, a definite decision on this point cannot
be arrived at beforehand. It is, moreover, essential that the plan of
your first attack should not definitely commit your troops to a further
advance unless the trend of events should render such a course
desirable.</p>

<p>8. As regards the date for launching your first attack, it is thought
that the most favourable time would be shortly before the main
operations at Anzac begin, and you should therefore arrange for your
first attack to take place on the 4th August.</p>

<p>9. Beyond holding the enemy in front of them to their positions and
assisting you with artillery fire, the French will not be asked to take
part in your first attack, but, in the event of your reaching Krithia,
they will be directed to conform to your movements and to establish
themselves on the spurs leading up to <location heights="Achi Baba">Achi Baba</location>.</p>

<p>I will ascertain the amount of artillery support and lean you can expect
from the C.E.O., and if the information arrives in time will attach it
as an appendix to this letter.</p>

<p>10. The possibility of the southern force being able to capture Achi
Baba has not been dealt with in this memorandum, as the attempt should
only be made in the event of large reinforcements being available for
the southern zone, and these must depend on the course of events in the
main theatre.</p>

<p>                         (_Signed_) W. P. BRAITHWAITE,</p>

<p>                                  _Major-General, C.G.S.,
                              Mediterranean Expeditionary Force._</p>

<p>It will be apparent to you how necessary it is not to allow any
suspicion of the reason for the date mentioned in paragraph 8 being told
to any person other than your Brigadier-General G.S.</p>

<p>                                               (_Intd._) W. P. B.</p>

<p>APPENDIX.</p>

<p>_French Artillery Support for 8th Corps._</p>

<p>1. One Brigade of 75's will be placed at the disposal of the 8th Corps
for the attack on 4th-5th August.</p>

<p>Of these</p>

<p>(_a_) One battery will be moved to support closely the attack on
Krithia.</p>

<p>(_b_) One battery will fire up the Nullah E. of Krithia.</p>

<p>2. In addition, six French howitzers will be so disposed as to open fire
upon <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> artillery north of the ridge 150--<location heights="Achi Baba">Achi Baba</location> peak.</p>


<p>INSTRUCTIONS FOR G.O.C. A. AND N.Z. ARMY CORPS.</p>

<p>Reference Map Anafarta Sagir <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location> Map 1/20,000.</p>

<p>1. The General Commanding has decided to mass the whole of his
reinforcements in and immediately north of the area occupied by the
corps under your command, with a view to securing <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay as a base of
operations, driving the enemy off the <location heights="Sari Bair">Sari Bair</location>, and eventually securing
a position astride the <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location> Peninsula from the neighbourhood of
Gaba Tepe to the straits north of Maidos.</p>

<p>2. The general outline for your proposals for the action of the A. and
N.Z. Army Corps contained in your G a 89 of 1st July are approved.</p>

<p>3. (_a_) The General Commanding wishes your operations to begin on
August 6th with a strong and sustained attack on Hill 125 (Plateau 400),
every effort being made to deceive the enemy as to the locality against
which our main effort is to be made, and to induce him to believe that
it will be directed against his lines opposite the southern portion of
your position. In pursuance of this object the Vice-Admiral has arranged
that H.M. ships shall in the meantime display increased activity off
the coast between Gaba Tepe and Kum Tepe. It has been arranged that
soundings shall be taken by night off the coast south of Gaba Tepe; and,
on the evening of August 6th, a naval demonstration will be made off
this part of the coast, H.M. ships being accompanied by a number of
trawlers as if a landing were to be undertaken.</p>

<p>(_b_) The General Commanding further concurs in the subsequent sequence
of the operations outlined by you, namely:--</p>

<p>(i) The clearing of the enemy's outposts from the ridges facing Nos. 2
and 3 posts, to be undertaken after nightfall.</p>

<p>(ii) An attack in as great strength as possible up the Sazli Beit Dere,
the Chailak Dere and the Aghyl Dere, against the Chunuk Bair ridge, by
night.</p>

<p>(iii) When the Chunuk Bair ridge is gained, a converging attack from
that ridge, and from the north-eastern section of your present position,
against Hill 180 (Baby 700).</p>

<p>4. (_a_) For the above operations the following troops will be at your
disposal:--</p>

<p>A. and N.Z. Army Corps. <unit type="division">13th Division</unit>, less all artillery except 69th
F.A. (Howitzer) Brigade. 29th Brigade (10th Division). 29th <location country="India">Indian</location>
Brigade.</p>

<p>(_b_) At the date of commencement of the operations the following troops
belonging to or attached to the 9th Army Corps will be at Anzac, but
will not, except so far as is stated hereunder, be at your disposal:--</p>

<p>One F.A. Brigade, 11th Division: To rejoin 9th Army Corps as soon as
horses are landed.</p>

<p>10th Heavy Battery, R.G.A.: Ditto.</p>

<p>14th Lowland (Howitzer) Brigade (two Batteries): Arrangements must be
made so that these batteries may be free to rejoin the 9th Army Corps
before nightfall on August 7th.</p>

<p>5. The operations carried out by the Corps under your command will form
part of a general combined offensive undertaken by the whole of the
forces of the <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location> Peninsula and by the 9th Army Corps, which will
be disembarked in the neighbourhood of <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay, beginning on the night
of August 6th-7th.</p>

<p>(_a_) The 8th Army Corps, in conjunction with the Corps Expéditionnaire,
will attack the <location country="Turkey">Turkish</location> lines south of Krithia on August 4th and 5th.
The attack will be made on a large scale, and will be vigorously
pressed, and it is hoped that by its means the enemy will be induced to
move part of his central reserves southward into the Cape <location country="Greece">Helles</location> zone
during the 5th and 6th, so that they may not be available in the
northern zone on the 6th and 7th.</p>

<p>(_b_) The 9th Army Corps will begin landing in and close to <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay
during the night of August 6th-7th. Three infantry brigades, with one
field and two mountain batteries, engineers and medical services, should
be ashore before dawn, and will be closely followed by two more infantry
brigades and additional artillery and engineers.</p>

<p>The G.O.C. 9th Army Corps has been informed:--</p>

<p>(i) That his mission is to secure <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay as a base of operation for
all the forces in the northern zone.</p>

<p>(ii) That the seizure of Yilghin Burnu and Ismail Oglu Tepe ("W" and
Chocolate Hills), on account of the presence there of artillery which
may interfere with your operations, must be considered as of very
special importance.</p>

<p>(iii) That so far as is possible after the fulfilment of his primary
mission, he is to render you such direct assistance as may be
practicable by moving any available troops via Biyuk Anafarta up the
eastern slopes of the <location heights="Sari Bair">Sari Bair</location>.</p>

<p>(_c_) At the commencement of these operations the infantry of the 53rd
Division will be available as Army Reserve and will be at the disposal
of the General Commanding.</p>

<p>6. The Vice-Admiral has agreed provisionally to the following allotment
of ships affording naval support to the operations:--</p>

<p>In <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay: One 6-in. monitor.</p>

<p>South of Kuchuk: H.M.S. _Endymion_.</p>

<p>Kemliki (Nibrunesi Point): H.M.S. _Edgar_, H.M.S. _Talbot_, one 6-in.
monitor, one 9.2-in. monitor. These ships would be in position at
daylight on August 7th, and would mainly be required to support the
operations of the 9th Army Corps.</p>

<p>     West of Gaba Tepe: H.M.S. _Baccanto_, H.M.S. _Humber_, H.M.S.
     _Havelock_, one 6-in. monitor.</p>

<p>These ships would be in position at 3 p.m. on August 6th, except H.M.S.
_Havelock_, which would be in position at daylight on August 7th. They
would be detailed for support of the right flank of the A. and N.Z. Army
Corps.</p>

<p>     Off Kum Tepe: One 6-in. monitor.</p>

<p>A separate communication is being sent to you with regard to the final
settlement of details as to the support of the operations by naval guns,
allocation of targets, etc.</p>

<p>7. Special instructions regarding signal communication will be issued
later. In general terms the arrangements will be as follows:--</p>

<p>A submarine cable and a land cable will be laid between Anzac and <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location>
     Bay as soon as circumstances permit.</p>

<p>A submarine cable will also be laid as soon as practicable between
     <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location> and <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay. Pending the completion of connection between
     Anzac and <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay, inter-communication will be carried out by
     lamp.</p>

<p>Two military pack W/T stations and a R.N. Base W/T station will be
     established in the vicinity of <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay. The W/T station at Anzac
     will be able to intercept messages from seaplanes, but must not
     attempt to reply.</p>

<p>W/T via the ships will be an alternative means of communication between
     G.H.Q. and the troops ashore in case of interruption of cable
     communication.</p>

<p>A system of flares will be arranged for employment on the left flank of
     your position at dawn on August 7th to indicate to the ships the
     positions reached by the troops.</p>

<p>8. G.H.Q. will in the first instance be at <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>.</p>

<p>FORCE ORDER No. 25.</p>

<p>                                            GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,</p>

<p>                                               _2nd August, 1915._</p>


<p>1. The total forces of the enemy in the <location peninsula="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</location> Peninsula are
estimated at 100,000.</p>

<p>Of these, 27,000 are in the neighbourhood of Anzac (5th, 19th, 16th
Divisions, and 18th and 64th Regiments); 36,000 are in the Southern zone
(1st, 4th, 6th Division less one regiment, 7th Division, 11th Division
less one regiment, and one regiment each of the 12th, 25th and 3rd
Divisions); and 37,000 are in Reserve (9th Division less one regiment,
12th less one regiment, 13th, 14th, and 25th less one regiment, and 10th
Divisions). Of this reserve force two Divisions are in the Bulair
district and one Division in the Eyerli Tepe zone. There are 12,000 on
the Asiatic shore of the <location straits="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</location> (<unit type="division">2nd Division</unit> and <unit type="division">8th Division</unit> less
one regiment). There are believed to be five Divisions (45,000 men) in
the Keshan area belonging to the 5th and 6th Corps.</p>

<p>All reports tend to show that though the enemy may be expected to fight
well in trenches, their _moral_ has suffered considerably as a result of
their recent heavy casualties, and that their stock of ammunition is
low.</p>

<p>2. The General Commanding intends to carry out a combined and
simultaneous attack on the enemy in the northern and southern zone
commencing on 6th August, in accordance with the special instructions
already issued to the Corps Commanders concerned.</p>

<p>During the first phase of these operations the <unit type="division">13th Division</unit> (less three
18-pdr. Bdes. R.F.A.), the 29th Infantry Brigade will be attached to the
A. and N.Z. Army Corps. Three squadrons R.N. Armoured Car Division and
two batteries Highland Mounted Artillery will be attached to 9th Corps.
86th Brigade R.F.A. and 91st Heavy Battery R.G.A. will be attached to
8th Corps.</p>

<p>3. Special instructions regarding embarkation and disembarkation are
issued to G.O.C. 9th Corps, G.O.C., A. and N.Z. Corps, and I.G.C., as
appended to this order.</p>

<p>4. The <unit type="division">53rd Division</unit> will remain at the disposal of the General
Commanding as general reserve.</p>

<p>5. G.H.Q. will remain in the first instance in its present situation.</p>

<p>                                    _(Signed)_ W. P. BRAITHWAITE,</p>

<p>                                        _Major-General, C.G.S.,
                                 Mediterranean Expeditionary Force._</p>

<p>Issued to: G.O.C. Corps Expéditionnaire; G.O.C. A. and N.Z. Army Corps;
G.O.C. 8th Army Corps; G.O.C. 9th Army Corps; G.O.C. <unit type="division">53rd Division</unit>;
I.G.C.; Vice-Admiral.</p>


<p>APPENDIX TO FORCE ORDER NO. 25.</p>

<p>_Embarkations._</p>

<p>1. The embarkation of units of the 9th Corps concentrated at <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location> will
be carried out under the orders of G.O.C. 9th Corps, commencing for
personnel on 6th August, for vehicles and stores at such earlier date as
may be convenient. The necessary ships and boats (lists of which have
already been handed to the G.O.C. Corps) will be assembled in the
harbour beforehand; and the embarkation programme will be worked out in
consultation with Commander Ashby, R.N., who has been detailed by the
Vice-Admiral for this purpose, and who will arrange for the various
vessels to be in their allotted positions at the hours arranged.</p>

<p>G.O.C. 9th Corps will also be responsible for the allocation to ships or
lighters, and for the embarkation of the following units:--</p>



<p>At <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>: One W.T. Section (Nos. W. 10 and W. 11 Pack Wireless
Stations); Two Anson Battalions R.N.D. (for duties on the beach); No. 16
Casualty Clearing Station.</p>

<p>In transit from <location town="Mudros">Mudros</location> to <location island="Imbros">Imbros</location>: One Casualty Clearing Station.</p>

<p>Units and formations concentrated at <location town="Mudros">Mudros</location> and Mitylene will be
embarked for their various destinations under the orders of I.G.C. in
accordance with the programme already issued to that officer.</p>


<p>_Military Transport Officers._</p>

<p>2. G.O.C. 9th Corps and I.G.C. respectively will ensure that an officer
is appointed Military Transport Officer on every ship for the
embarkation of which they are severally responsible (_vide_ paragraph
1).</p>


<p>_Landing Places._</p>

<p>3. The landings of the 9th Corps will be referred to as "A," "B," and
"C" Beaches.</p>

<p>"A" Beach--Square 117.q. and v.</p>

<p>"C" Beach--Square 103.u.z.</p>

<p>"B" Beach--Square 91.b, i, o.</p>

<p>"C" and "B" Beaches are practically contiguous.</p>


<p>_Beach Control Personnel._</p>

<p>4. The following naval and military beach control personnel have been
appointed for the landing places of the 9th Corps:--</p>



<p>Principal Beach Master: Captain H. F. G. Talbot, R.N.</p>

<p>Beach Masters: Commander I. W. Gibson, M.V.O. ("A" Beach), Captain C. P.
Metcalfe, R.N. ("B" Beach), Commander C. Tindal-Carril-Worsley ("C"

<p>Principal Mil. L.O.: Colonel W. G. B. Western, C.B.</p>

<p>Mil. L.O.'s: Major F. W. Pencock, Derbyshire Yeomanry, Major Sir R.
Baker, Dorset Yeomanry, Captain Tylsen Wright, A.S.C.</p>

<p>Assistant Mil. L.O.'s: Captain Wade Palmer, Derbyshire Yeomanry, Captain
B. A. Smith, South Notts Hussars, Lieutenant H. V. Browne, Dorset
Yeomanry, Lieutenant Krabbe, Berks Yeomanry.</p>

<p>The allocation of the above military officers to the various landing
places will be detailed by the P.M.L.O. in consultation with the P.B.M.</p>

<p>Special instructions with regard to beach fatigue parties have already
been issued to the G.O.C. 9th Corps.</p>

<p>G.O.C., A. and N.Z. Army Corps will detail such military landing
officers, assistant military landing officers, and beach parties for
A.N.Z.A.C. as he may consider necessary. The names of officers so
appointed will be reported as early as possible to V.A. and to G.H.Q.</p>

<p>The following special service officers are attached to H.Q., A. and N.Z.
Army Corps, for such duties in connection with the landing as the G.O.C.
may direct:--</p>



<p>Major P. R. Bruce, S. Notts Hussars.</p>

<p>Captain C. R. Higgens, County of London Yeomanry.</p>

<p>Captain Sir E. Pauncefort Duncombe, Royal Bucks Hussars.</p>


<p>_General Instructions for Landing._</p>

<p>5. All troops will land with two iron rations (one day's meat only in
case of troops disembarking at Anzac). Infantry will carry 200 rounds of
S.A.A., machine-gun sections 3,500 rounds. Packs will not be worn. A
proportion of heavy entrenching tools, signalling and medical gear will
be carried by hand. Camp kettles will be handed to the Ordnance Officer
of the camp at which units concentrate before embarkation. They will be
forwarded and reissued at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>6. Horses will be landed harnessed, and with nosebags filled to their
full capacity.</p>

<p>Poles of G.S. wagons will be removed before slinging and made fast to
the body of the wagon. Poles of carts, limbers, and limbered wagons will
not be removed; these vehicles should be so placed in the boats that
they can be landed pole leading.</p>


<p>_Ammunition._</p>

<p>7. The G.O.C. 9th Corps will depute an officer to arrange, in
consultation with the P.M.L.O., for the storing of reserve ammunition in
convenient localities near the beach. Guards for these stores may be
found from the beach fatigue parties.</p>


<p>_Water._</p>

<p>8. The strictest economy must be exercised with regard to drinking
water. Under arrangements already made by G.H.Q., receptacles filled
with water will be landed as early as possible from the ships carrying
the mule corps, and will be conveyed to the troops as transport becomes
available. Waterproof tanks (2,300 gallon capacity) and lift and force
pumps will be available on the _Prah_--R.E. Storeship--in Kephalos
Harbour, and will be forwarded by D.Q.M.G., G.H.Q., on request of G.O.C.
Corps.</p>


<p>_Transport._</p>

<p>9. Transport to supplement that in possession of units will be provided
for the 9th Corps and the A.N.Z. Corps by the <location country="India">Indian</location> Mule Corps. The
amount of transport for each formation has been calculated to carry
rations, water, and S.A.A., making one or two trips a day, according to
the anticipated distance of the various units from the beach.</p>

<p>This transport will be handed over, as it is landed, by an officer
appointed by the D.S.T., to transport officers of Brigades and
divisional troops for allotment as circumstances may require.</p>

<p>Senior transport officers of Divisions will be ordered to report to the
following representatives of the D.S.T. immediately on landing:--</p>



<p>At Anzac: Lieutenant-Colonel Streidinger, A.D.T.</p>

<p>At "A" Beach: Major Badcock, D.A.D.T.</p>


<p>_Supplies._</p>

<p>10. A supply depôt has been formed at Anzac, and it is in charge of
Major Izod, A.S.C. A supply depot will be formed by D.S.T. at "A" Beach
as soon as supplies can be landed, and will be in charge of Major
Huskisson, A.S.C. Senior supply officers of Divisions will be ordered to
place themselves in communication with the officer in charge of the
nearest supply depôt and to keep him informed of their daily
requirements. Supplies will, so far as possible, be handed over to them
in bulk at the depôt. Owing to the difficulty in landing sufficient
animals in the first instance it is possible that only half rations may
be available on the third and fourth days after the operations begin.
All units should be specially ordered to husband their rations.</p>


<p>_Medical._</p>

<p>11. Arrangements have been made to establish on the beach at Anzac two
casualty clearing stations, which will be embarked by I.G.C., and two
at "A" Beach, which will be embarked under orders of G.O.C. 9th Corps
(_see_ paragraph 1). Medical officers will be appointed by G.H.Q. to
control these units, and to take charge of the arrangements for
evacuation of the wounded from the beach.</p>

<p>APPENDIX IV</p>

<p>INSTRUCTIONS TO MAJOR-GENERAL H. DE LISLE, C.B., D.S.O.</p>


<p>1. The operations of the northern wing of the Army have only been
partially successful.</p>

<p>(_a_) The <location country="Australia">Australia</location> and <location country="New Zealand">New Zealand</location> Army Corps, with the <unit type="division">13th Division</unit>
and the 29th Brigade of <unit type="division">10th Division</unit> attached, has greatly extended the
area occupied, and now holds a position under the Chunuk Bair Ridge,
which the G.O.C. considers a favourable one from which to launch the
final attack on the ridge. The necessity for reorganization after the
recent operations, and for establishing a satisfactory system of
forwarding water, ammunition and supplies, will involve a delay of some
days before the attack on the main ridge can be made.</p>

<p>(_b_) The 9th Army Corps, less the 13th Division and 29th Brigade, but
with the 53rd and 54th Divisions attached, holds the Yilghin Burnu
hills, and a line northwards from the easternmost of these two hills
roughly straight across the Kuchuk Anafarta Ova to the highest point of
the Kiretch Tepe Sirt. Attacks by the 11th Division against the Ismail
Oglu Tepe and the Anafarta spur from the north-west have been made
without any success. In the course of the operations the 9th Corps
became very much disorganized, and since August 11th the work of
reorganization and consolidation has been proceeding.</p>

<p>2. At present the enemy has shown no great strength north of an east and
west line through Anafarta Sagir. He has a force operating on and near
the Kiretch Tepe Sirt, the strength of which cannot yet be accurately
estimated. From present indications this appears to be a detachment
which is known to have guarded the coast from Ejelmer Bay to <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay;
it does not appear to have been reinforced to any extent. Across the
Kuchuk Anafarta Ova there appear to be no more than snipers. In the
region Anafarta Sagir--Ismail Oglu Tepe and the Biyuk Anafarta Valley
the enemy has developed considerable strength--his intention being, no
doubt, to protect the right of his main force which opposes the
<location country="Australia">Australia</location> and <location country="New Zealand">New Zealand</location> Army Corps, and to prevent our advance on the
Anafarta gap.</p>

<p>3. The General Commanding has decided to strike as quickly and in as
great strength as possible against the enemy's on the line Ismail Oglu
Tepe--Anafarta Sagir with the objects, first, of driving in this flank
and preparing a further enveloping advance; and, secondly, by clearing
the Anafarta spur to deny to the enemy the gun positions and facilities
for observation therefrom, which would otherwise endanger <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay. He
considers it imperative to effect this with the least possible delay. In
his view the left flank of this advance will require comparatively
little protection, at all events in the first instance, in view of the
difficulty which the enemy may be expected to find in throwing any
considerable force round our left over the high and difficult country
north of Anafarta Sagir. It appears that the double purpose of defeating
the enemy and securing <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay as a port for the northern wing of the
Army can best be served by an attack on the enemy's right on the
Anafarta spur, made with all the strength at our command, while leaving
a comparatively small force as left flank guard to clear the enemy's
snipers out of the Kuchuk Anafarta Ova and to occupy and press back his
detachment in the Ejelmer Bay region.</p>

<p>4. You will have at your disposal the following troops:--</p>

<p>  11th Division,
  10th Division (less 29th Brigade),
  <unit type="division">53rd Division</unit>,
  <unit type="division">54th Division</unit>,</p>

<p>and there is on its way from <location country="Egypt">Egypt</location> to join you the 2nd Mounted Division
(5,000 men dismounted), which should be available by August 18th. The
10th, 11th and 53rd Divisions are considerably depleted, and the _moral_
of the latter at present leaves much to be desired. There are at present
ashore, belonging to the above two F.A. Brigades (three batteries of
which are awaiting horses to bring them up from Anzac) and two Heavy
Batteries. In addition, two Highland Mountain Batteries, attached to the
9th Corps, are ashore, and the 1/4th Lowland Brigade (two batteries
5-inch howitzers) are at your disposal when they can be brought up from
Anzac. It has only been possible to land a bare minimum of horses owing
to difficulties in respect of water and the landing of forage.</p>

<p>Three further F.A. Brigades and the 57th Brigade (two batteries)
4.5-inch howitzers are at <location town="Mudros">Mudros</location> ready to be brought up as soon as it is
possible to land them. These Brigades will probably have to be landed
without any horses in the first instance, and taken into position by the
artillery horses already ashore.</p>

<p>5. For the purpose of an early attack in accordance with the plan
indicated in paragraph 3, the A. and N.Z. Army Corps will probably not
be able to co-operate directly with more than one Infantry Brigade, and
it is possible that it may be able to do no more than swing up its left
into line with the right of your advance. It is improbable that the 8th
Corps and the C.E.O. will be in a position to do more than undertake
vigorous demonstrations.</p>

<p>6. With the above in view, you will proceed at once to <location bay="Suvla">Suvla</location> Bay and
take over command of the 9th Corps. Your immediate and most urgent
concern will be to complete the reorganization of the Corps and to
prepare as large a force as possible for the offensive against Ismail
Oglu Tepe and the Anafarta spur, bearing in mind that time is of vital
importance. You will then consider and report at the earliest moment:--</p>

<p>     (_a_) What force you consider that you will be able to employ for
     this purpose.</p>

<p>     (_b_) The date on which you will be ready to undertake the
     offensive.</p>

<p>     (_c_) The method by which you purpose to carry out your task.</p>

<p>  (_Signed_) W. P. BRAITHWAITE,</p>

<p>  _Major-General, Chief of the General Staff,</p>

<p>  Mediterranean Expeditionary Force._</p>
